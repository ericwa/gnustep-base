2005-04-19  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Tools/gdomap.c (init_iface): Round size to make sure we don't violate
	pointer alignment boundaries.

2005-04-14  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/Additions/GSMime.m: Add tweak to cope with buggy mailers
	which insert space after the boundary in a multipart document.

2005-04-13  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* ANNOUNCE, NEWS, Documentation/news.texi,
	Documentation/ReleaseNotes.gsdoc: Merge in release info from
	1.10.3 release branch.

2005-04-12  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Headers/Foundation/NSDistributedNotificationCenter.h:
	Added GSPublicNotificationCenterType and changed documentation for
	NSLocalNotificationCenterType to say it's private to the current user.
	* Source/NSDistributedNotificationCenter.m: Changed so that
	NSLocalNotificationCenterType is MacOS-X compatible and the new
	GSPublicNotificationCenterType works like our old implementation.
	* Source/NSPortNameServer.m: Add detailed message about forthcoming
	change to make the default port name server deal with message ports
	rather than socket ports ... for MacOS-X compatibility and security.
	* Source/externs.m: Added GSPublicNotificationCenterType
	* Tools/gdnc.m: Changes for new NSDistributedNotificationCenter
	behavior.
	Overview ... updated distributed notifications to be private to the
	owner of the processes by default.  Added one-time warning message
	for developers that NSConnection will be changing the same way.
	These changes discussed a year or two ago (mostly with Alexander),
	but nobody ever actually implemented them.
	* Source/NSPathUtilities.m: Make temporary directory name based on
	uid so that it is consistent on a unix system where there are
	multiple named accounts with the same user id (essentially all
	aliases for a single account).

2005-04-05  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* gnustep-base.spec.in: Update make dependancy

2005-04-05  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSString.m: ([sttringByAppendingPathComponent:]) Fix bug
	eliding multiple slashes in path.

2005-04-02  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSTask.m: Fix missing nul terminator to arguments under win32

2005-04-01  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSBundle.m: Minor debug/warning log tweaks.
	* Headers/Foundation/NSBundle.h: Document differences between GNUstep
	and MacOS-X when initialising using a relative path.
	* Headers/NSString.h: Fix typo in comment.

2005-03-31  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* ANNOUNCE, NEWS, Documentation/news.texi,
	Documentation/ReleaseNotes.gsdoc: Merge in release info from
	1.10.2 release branch.

2005-03-31  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSBundle.m (_find_framework): New function.
	([NSBundle +_addFrameworkFromClass:]): Use it. Based on patch
	from Sheldon Gill.

2005-03-31  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSString.m: (isAbsolutePath) always treat a path beginning
	with '/' as absolute except when in windows mode or on windows and
	not in unix mode.  Treat all UNC paths as absolute ... a change made
	after a lot of trawling the web and looking at examples of UNC path
	usage.

2005-03-23  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* config/pathxml.m4: Fix to get --with-xml-prefix= to work for
	xml2-config
	* configure: regenerated

2005-03-22  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/Additions/GSMime.m: Fix some charset-encoding mappings.
	Add utf-7 and utf-16.
	Add all aliases for ascii and latin1
	Document mapping methods better.

2005-03-21  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Headers/Foundation/NSFileManager.h: Add path handling documentation.
	* Headers/Foundation/NSString.h: Add path handling methods
	documentation and new method to set global path handling mode.
	* Source/NSUserDefaults.m: Update path handling mode when defaults
	are read in.
	* Source/NSString.m: Implement selectable path handling mode ...
	gnustep/unix/windows.  In the default gnustep mode we try to
	handle paths in any format and just do the right thing.
	Also updated handling of path extensions to match MacOSX behavior.
	* Source/Additions/GSMime.m: Remove deprecated method.
	Optimise a little by avoiding class lookups.

2005-03-18  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSPathUtilities.m: Use fprintf rather than NSLog to try to
	avoid possible recursion when errors occur.

2005-03-17  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSPathUtilities.m: Tidy variable and function names to fit
	GNUstep conventions.  Simplify code a little.  Don't attempt to parse
	per-user config file if its name is nil or empty string.
	Support parsing old config options for backward compatibility.

2005-03-15  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/Additions/GSMime.m: Ensure last line of base64 encoded data
	is terminated with crlf for clients which have buggy base64 decodedrs.

2005-03-15  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/Additions/GSMime.m: Mark ([setDefaultEncoding:]) as deprecated
	rather than just removing it ... in case someone has started using it.
	* Source/NSPathUtilities.m: Tidied a little ... moved a function.
	* Headers/Additions/GNUstepBase/GSFunctions.h: New header for functions
	* Headers/Foundation/NSPathUtilities.h: Moved function
	* Source/DocMakefile: Include GSFunctions.h
	* Source/GNUmakefile: ditto
	* Source/Additions/GNUmakefile: Build GSFunctions.m
	* Source/Additions/GSFunctions.m: New file for extra functions.
	* Source/NSString.m: ([stringByExpandingTildeInPath]) Improve handling
	of paths containing mingw drives.
	* Source/NSDate.m: Use same values for distant past/future as MacOSX
	* Source/NSCalendarDate.m: Support output of extreme year values.

2005-03-14  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Continuation of NSPathUtilities patches
	* configure.ac: Add config-file option
	* Headers/Foundation/NSPathUtilities.h: Add GSFindNamedFile, more 
	NSSearchPathDirectory enums.
	* Source/GNUmakefile: Don't install Win32 headers.
	* Source/NSPathUtilities.m (InitializePathUtilities, ...): Add
	support for reading standard path locations from a configuration
	file. Various support functions added/removed to fit.
	(GSFindNamedFile): New function.
	(GSSetUserName): Do nothing if the user is the same.
	(NSHomeDirectoryForUser): Use Windows utilities to get user name
	(on Windows, of course).
	(NSFullUserName): Default to NSUserName on Windows.
	(GSSystemRootDirectory): Mark as deprecated.
	(GSDefaultsRootForUser): Correctly return the actual defaults
	directory, not the user directory.
	(GSStandardPathPrefixes): Mark as deprecated.
	(NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains): Add platform paths and
	additional search directories.
	* Source/NSUserDefaults (pathForUser): Correct use of
	GSDefaultsRootForUser. Remove obsolete path checking and
	defaults location checking. (Patches from Sheldon Gill
	with some modifications).

	* Documentation/Base.gsdoc: Update documentation.
	* Headers/Additions/GNUstepBase/Win32_Utilities.h,
	Source/win32/Win32_Utilities.m: Fix function arguments.

2005-03-12  Sungjin Chun <chuns@embian.com>

	* Source/Additions/GSXML.m: Port to MacOS-X

2005-03-11  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSPropertyList.m: Handle null object passed to OAppend()
	* Source/Additions/GSMime.m: Optimise setDefaultCharset: a little
	Add error checking to setDefaultEncoding: to make sure it sets a
	valid characterset encoding. Should almost certainly remove this
	method though ... as it duplicates setDefaultCharset: functionality
	in a somewhat less useful form.

2005-03-11  David Wetzel <dave@turbocat.de>
        * Source/Additions/GSMime.m:
        * Headers/Additions/GNUstepBase/GSMime.h
          Added setDefaultEncoding:
          This is needed in GSWeb if you use utf-8 and faster than using a
          String as encoding name.

2005-03-09  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSCharacterSet.m: Fix bug in forming union ... was using
	wrong length.

2005-03-08  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSCharacterSetData.h: Add data outside unicode base plane.
	* Source/NSCharacterSet.m: Change to support all unicode characters
	rather than just UTF16.  The current implementation is still based
	on (often much larger than before) bitmaps.  It may be that the size
	of the bitmap data is too large for real world use, and we may have
	to introduce a different storage mechanism.  The current mechanism
	is good for cases where the number of characters in the set is large
	and those characters are scattered, or where characters are only
	present in the base plane.  Another implementation might be better
	for cases where characters are clustered into contiguous groups
	and the groups are scattered through the full range.

2005-03-07  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Headers/Additions/GNUstepBase/GSConfig.h.in: Extra types
	* configure.ac: Added types for GSConfig.h.in
	* configure: regenerated
	* Headers/Foundation/NSCharacterSet.h: New MacOS-X methods
	* Headers/Foundation/NSIndexSet.h: Remove bogus comment.
	* Source/GNUmakefile: Don't build NSBitmapCharSet.m
	* Source/NSBitmapCharSet.h: Removed ... merege into NSCharacterSet.m
	* Source/NSBitmapCharSet.m: ditto
	* Source/NSCharacterSet.m: Optimise a few methods.
	Add new MacOS-X methods (naive implementations)
	Merge in NSBitmapCharSet as private class

2005-03-06  Matt Rice <ratmice@yahoo.com>

	* Headers/Foundation/NSRunLoop.h: Reorder RunLoopEventType for binary
	compatibility.

2005-03-06  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Headers/Foundation/NSCharacterSet.h: Add documentation and method
	([-capitalizedLetterCharacterSet]) Change name of symbol set to
	match MacOS-X
	* Source/NSCharacterSet.m: Add new method and move documentation to
	header.  Include local NSCharacterSetData.h for bitmap data.
	* Source/NSCharacterSetData.h: New file containing the bitmap data
	for the standard charactersets.  Generated by dev-apps/charsets
	tools using the latest unicode characterset data today.
	* Source/NSCharacterSets/README.CharSet: mark as obsolete.
	* Source/GNUmakefile: No longer build/install NSCharacterSets
	The standard bitmap data for charactersets is now built in to
	NSCharacterSet.
	* Headers/Foundation/NSBitmapChar.h: Moved nonstandard header
	to private source directory.
	* Source/NSAutoreleasePool.m: Rewrite deallocation to cause the pool
	to remain as the current pool during the deallocation process ...
	Requires deallocation to be done in a loop to avoid possible leaks
	etc if an object which is being deallocated decides to autorelease
	something.
	Also removed a few private methods for simplification.

2005-03-04  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/Additions/GSXML.m: GSXMLRPC integrated.
	* Headers/Additions/GSUstepBase/GSXML.h: GSXMLRPC integrated.

2005-03-03  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSFileManager.m (-createFileAtPath:...): Define var at
	beginning to work on gcc 2.x compilers.

2005-03-03  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Start on integrating Sheldon Gills NSPathUtilities patches.
	* Headers/Foundation/NSPathUtilities.h: Depreciate 
	GSSystemRootDirectory, GSStandardPathPrefixes. Add 
	GSPreferencesDirectory to NSSearchPathDirectory enum. Enumerate
	NSSearchPathDomainMask values.
	* Headers/Additions/GNUStepBase/Win32Support.h,
	Headers/Additions/GNUStepBase/Win32_Utilites.h: New files.
	* Source/GNUmakefile: Add NSPathUtilities.m
	* Source/NSUser.m: Move everything in here...
	* Source/NSPathUtilities.m: to here.
	* Source/win32/GNUmakefile: Add Win32Support.m, Win32_Utilities.m
	* Source/win32Win32Support.m, Win32_Utilities.m: New files
	* Testing/nspathutilites.m: New file.
	(Files and patches from Sheldon Gill with minor modifications).

2005-03-02  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Headers/Foundation/NSKeyValueCoding.h:
	* Source/NSArray.m:
	* Source/NSKeyValueCoding.m:
	* Source/Additions/GSObjCRuntime.m:
	On the way back from FOSDEM I updated tje key-value-coding stuff to
	match the lastest version from Apple/MacOS-X panther.
	I don't use KVC in my code, and have not testcases for it, so would
	appreciate it if anyone who does could try this out and get bug
	reports back to me ASAP.

2005-03-01  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSBundle.m (+gnustepBundle, 
	+pathForGNUstepResource:ofType:inDirectory:]): Add deprecated
	log message.
	* Source/NSNotificationQueue.m, Source/null-load.h: 
	Fix copyright message.

2005-03-01 02:50 Nicola Pero <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* Source/Makefile.preamble (ADDITIONAL_LIB_DIRS): When building a
	shared library, depend on all TARGET_SYSTEM_LIBS, not just
	CONFIG_SYSTEM_LIBS.
	* Headers/Additions/GNUstepBase/GSObjCRuntime.h: Do not use
	__declspec(dllexport) on mingw.  Use extern instead.
	
2005-02-28 17:45 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* NSCharacterSets/GNUmakefile: Use GNUSTEP_OBJ_DIR_NAME to run
	data conversion tool, since Tom Koelman points out that the 'obj'
	subdirectory does not work on windoze due to lack of symlinks.

2005-02-28 17:10 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSAutoreleasePool.m:
	* Source/NSCharacterSet.m:
	* Source/NSproxy.m:
	Damn ... when I ran the testsuite for the stuff I did at fosdem, it
	all worked ... but now I find that it was linking to an older version
	of the base library and actually the changes were broken.
	The new modifications should (hopefully) fix all breakage.
	The changes exposed rare bugs in the existing code ...
	NSCharacterSet was returning immutable copies of the standard
	character sets when it should return mutable ones, it was also
	being a bit bad about allocating new instances.  NSProxy was
	failing to implement instanceMethodForSelector:, and NSAutoreleasePool
	had a bug which could mess up a bit if the objects being deallocated
	by it autoreleased anything.

2005-02-28  David Ayers  <d.ayers@inode.at>

	* Source/NSPropertyList.m (OAppend): Attempt to transform
	description of non-proporty-list objects into property list
	before recursing for OPENSTEP compatibility.
	
2005-02-27 13:20 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSConnection.m:
	Set default timeouts to maximum timeouts for MacOS-X compatibility.

2005-02-27 08:45 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* NSCharacterSets/dataToheader.c: new file to convert data files to
	constant values in a new header (NSCharacterSetData.h).
	* NSCharacterSets/GNUmakefile: build header from data files, and
	don't create resource set, since we no longer use the files at runtime.
	* Source/NSCharacterSet.m: include NSCharacterSetData.h and use it to
	create the standard charactersets rather than reading from data files.
	This has two advantages - It avoids the need to install characterset
	data files with the library, and it means that we have characterset
	data available immediately (before we need to access the filesystem)
	so we can use charactersets and NSString methods which depend upon them
	earlier on in the system initialisation.

2005-02-27 00:50 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSAutoreleasePool.m: ([-dealloc]) cache method implementations
	for release calls on the assumption that many of the objects in the
	pool will be of the same class.
	Optimisation suggested by Georg Wallmann

2005-02-23  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* configure.ac: Add test to check for poll emulation
	* Source/NSRunLoop.h: Don't use poll if we're just emulating.
	* Source/unix/GSRunLoopCtxt.m: Idem.

2005-02-23 14:00 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Headers/Additions/GNUstepBase/GSFileHandle.h: Add windows event
	* Headers/Foundation/NSPort.h:
	* Headers/Foundation/NSRunLoop.h:
	* Source/GNUmakefile:
	* Source/GSFileHandle.m:

	* Source/unix/Makefile.preamble:
	* Source/win32/GNUmakefile:
	* Source/win32/GSRunLoopCtxt.m:
	* Source/win32/GSRunLoopWatcher.m:
	* Source/win32/Makefile.preamble:
	* Source/win32/NSRunLoopWin32.m:
	Applied patch by Luis Cabellos to use native win32 event handling
	rather than unix style select/poll on a win32 system.
	Rewrote various chunks to simplify, conform to coding standards,
	work for me etc.  In particular, replaced code for thread
	synchronisation to use win32 Event rather than pipe.

2005-02-22  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Branched freeze-1_10_2 for Version: 1.10.2

2005-02-22 14:00 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Documentation/Base.gsdoc:
	* Source/GSPrivate.h:
	* Source/NSDebug.m:
	* Source/NSLog.m:
	* Source/NSUserDefaults.m:
	Add GSLogThread to include thread id in NSLog() and debug output.
	* Source/NSMessagePort.m:
	* Source/NSSocketPort.m:
	Remove thread reporting in some debug statements as it can be
	done universally using GSLogThread.

2005-02-22 11:12 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/GSFFCallInvocation.m:
	* Source/GSFormat.m:
	* Source/GSString.m:
	* Source/GSTemplateValue.m:
	* Source/NSAutoreleasePool.m:
	* Source/NSData.m:

	* Source/Additions/GSCategories.m:
	* Source/Additions/GSObjCRuntime.m:
	* Source/Additions/Unicode.m:
	* Source/Additions/behavior.m:
	Tidy up use of white space a little.

2005-02-21 20:30 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/GSFormat.m: Modified code to rewrite output to use correct
	decimal separator for locale (hopefully).  Also made a small
	performance improvement in processing digits for output.

2005-02-21 14:30 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/GSFormat.m:
	* Source/NSConnection.m:
	* Source/callframe.m:
	* Source/cifframe.m:
	Include malloc.h for systems where it is needed for alloca()
	* Tools/gdomap.c: Avoid some warnings on mingw32

2005-02-21 14:10 Stefan Urbanek <stefan@agentfarms.net>

	* Source/NSAttributedString.m: Fix loop decoding from archive.

2005-02-18 06:20 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSString.m: Tidy up some of last patch for unicode filesystem
	support.
	* Source/NSFileManager.m: Complete rewrite of  unicode filesystem
	support to make code more readable and to allow it to easily be
	turned off by commenting out the 'UNICODE' and '_UNICODE'
	definitions at the start of the file.
	There is a bug in the mingw runtime which is (currently) still
	distributed in the 'current' complete mingw distribution ... which
	breaks unicode filesystem support very badly.
	So ... you can now either revert to 8bit charset filesystem support,
	or download a more recent version of the mingw runtime from the
	mingw site.
	* Source/NSTask.m: Fix setting environment for mingw ... use own
	method to get environment rather than examining instance variable,
	as the variable may not be set.  Sort variables because windows needs
	them in alphabetical order.  Fix conversion to unicode.

	2005-02-16 14:40 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* config/patchxml.m4: Try to detect libxml2 in standard directories
	exen if xml2-config is not present.
	* configure.ac: Detect libxml2 becore iconv, in case libxml2
	requires iconv (which it usually will on a system where iconv is
	not built into the standard c library).
	* confingure: Regenerate
	* Source/Additions/GSXML.m: Set memory allocation functions to be
	used by libxml2, so we can use objc_free() to release strings returned
	by the library, and avoid linker problem with xmlFree() on mingw.

2005-02-15 08:00 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSTask.m: Fix incorrect version comitted.

2005-02-14 08:00 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSTask.m: Pass environment settings for mingw based on
	anonymous bug submission (bug #11360)
	* Source/NSUser.m: Fix bug #11378
	* Tools/gdomap.c: Quote mingw arguments toi fix bug #11854
	* Documentation/manual/Introduction.texi: Apply patch by pupeno
	(bug #11814)

2005-02-10 01:05  Alexander Malmberg  <alexander@malmberg.org>

	* Tools/gdnc.m (main): Remove the program name from the arguments
	given to the new task.

2005-02-08 11:20 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSString.m: (unicodeString) rewrite to conform to coding
	standards and to be more efficient.

2005-02-08 10:10 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Tools/gdnc.m: Rewrite startup code to create a daemon using NSTask
	rather than calling fork()/spawn() etc.
	Make arguments more consistent with gpbs
	* Source/NSTask.m: Minor code layout/indentation tweaks.

2005-02-02 09:40 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSFileManager.m: Restructure last patch to conform to
	gnustep coding standards.
	(localFromOpenStepPath:) for unix paths, expand '~' abbreviations.

2005-01-31  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Documentation/coding-standards.texi: Add section of documentation.

2005-01-29 03:46 Matt Rice <ratmice@yahoo.com>
	
	* Source/NSUndoManager.m (-registerUndoWithTarget:selector:object:):
	Have the invocation to retain it's arguments. (Fixes bug #4692.)

2005-01-21 22:08 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: [NSUndoManager redo] and 
	[NSUndoManager undoNestedGroup] moved the call to actionName
	to a later point in both methods to get the name from the 
	"groupToRedo" or the "groupToUndo" respectively.  This 
	corrects the issue with the wrong name sometimes appearing
	in the redo/undo menu items.

2005-01-16 07:59 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: Added code to properly set the
	name of the action when undo/redo is called. 

2005-01-16 06:37 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: Check if the group is nil in 
	endUndoGrouping before checking the count.

2005-01-15 06:17 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: Undid previous change here.

2005-01-15 06:13 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: Localized undo/redo menu title.

2005-01-14 06:50 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: Correction for redo.

2005-01-14 05:43 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: Fix forward invocation to not add
	a group when it doesn't contain any actions. 

2005-01-08  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSCalendarDate.m: fix time zone for %z format with
