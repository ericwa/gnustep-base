	* Source/NSAttributedString.m: Fix loop decoding from archive.

2005-02-18 06:20 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSString.m: Tidy up some of last patch for unicode filesystem
	support.
	* Source/NSFileManager.m: Complete rewrite of  unicode filesystem
	support to make code more readable and to allow it to easily be
	turned off by commenting out the 'UNICODE' and '_UNICODE'
	definitions at the start of the file.
	There is a bug in the mingw runtime which is (currently) still
	distributed in the 'current' complete mingw distribution ... which
	breaks unicode filesystem support very badly.
	So ... you can now either revert to 8bit charset filesystem support,
	or download a more recent version of the mingw runtime from the
	mingw site.
	* Source/NSTask.m: Fix setting environment for mingw ... use own
	method to get environment rather than examining instance variable,
	as the variable may not be set.  Sort variables because windows needs
	them in alphabetical order.  Fix conversion to unicode.

	2005-02-16 14:40 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* config/patchxml.m4: Try to detect libxml2 in standard directories
	exen if xml2-config is not present.
	* configure.ac: Detect libxml2 becore iconv, in case libxml2
	requires iconv (which it usually will on a system where iconv is
	not built into the standard c library).
	* confingure: Regenerate
	* Source/Additions/GSXML.m: Set memory allocation functions to be
	used by libxml2, so we can use objc_free() to release strings returned
	by the library, and avoid linker problem with xmlFree() on mingw.

	* Source/NSTask.m: Fix incorrect version comitted.

2005-02-14 08:00 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSTask.m: Pass environment settings for mingw based on
	anonymous bug submission (bug #11360)
	* Source/NSUser.m: Fix bug #11378
	* Tools/gdomap.c: Quote mingw arguments toi fix bug #11854
	* Documentation/manual/Introduction.texi: Apply patch by pupeno
	(bug #11814)

2005-02-10 01:05  Alexander Malmberg  <alexander@malmberg.org>

	* Tools/gdnc.m (main): Remove the program name from the arguments
	given to the new task.

2005-02-08 11:20 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSString.m: (unicodeString) rewrite to conform to coding
	standards and to be more efficient.

2005-02-08 10:10 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Tools/gdnc.m: Rewrite startup code to create a daemon using NSTask
	rather than calling fork()/spawn() etc.
	Make arguments more consistent with gpbs
	* Source/NSTask.m: Minor code layout/indentation tweaks.

2005-02-02 09:40 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSFileManager.m: Restructure last patch to conform to
	gnustep coding standards.
	(localFromOpenStepPath:) for unix paths, expand '~' abbreviations.

2005-01-31  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Documentation/coding-standards.texi: Add section of documentation.

2005-01-29 03:46 Matt Rice <ratmice@yahoo.com>
	
	* Source/NSUndoManager.m (-registerUndoWithTarget:selector:object:):
	Have the invocation to retain it's arguments. (Fixes bug #4692.)

2005-01-21 22:08 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: [NSUndoManager redo] and 
	[NSUndoManager undoNestedGroup] moved the call to actionName
	to a later point in both methods to get the name from the 
	"groupToRedo" or the "groupToUndo" respectively.  This 
	corrects the issue with the wrong name sometimes appearing
	in the redo/undo menu items.

2005-01-16 07:59 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: Added code to properly set the
	name of the action when undo/redo is called. 

2005-01-16 06:37 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: Check if the group is nil in 
	endUndoGrouping before checking the count.

2005-01-15 06:17 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: Undid previous change here.

2005-01-15 06:13 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: Localized undo/redo menu title.

2005-01-14 06:50 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: Correction for redo.

2005-01-14 05:43 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: Fix forward invocation to not add
	a group when it doesn't contain any actions. 

2005-01-08  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSCalendarDate.m: fix time zone for %z format with 
	only 2 digits in -initWithString:calendarFormat:locale:	

2005-01-07  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSTimeZone.m (+abbreviationDictionary): Retain	dictionary
	(Fixes bug #11516).
