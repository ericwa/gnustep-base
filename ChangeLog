	* Version 1.11.2

2005-12-21  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Tools/AGSHtml.m: Partial update for use of CSS ... as provided by
	Fabien Vallon.  Need to decide where the stylesheet file should come
	from and where it should be installed.  Probably need a new autogsdoc
	flag for this and some internal api changes.

2005-12-20  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Tools/AGSParser.m: Deal with C++ declaration of external C/ObjC libs.

	library).
	* configure: regenerate

	Use the NSPortIsMessagePort user default consistently to control
	whether socket or message ports are used by default.  Remove mingw32
	specific GSMailslot user default.
	Source/NSPathUtilities.m: Check for illegal paths (ones which don't
	appear to be absolute paths) specified in config file ... warn about
	the bad config, but try to guess what they shjould be for mingw32

2005-11-20  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* configure.ac: Add flags to allow detection of headers/libraries
	installed in the System domain of the GNUstep hierarchy.
	* configure: regenerate
	* Source/win32/GSRunLoopCtxt.m: Intercept windows WM_QUIT messages
	and tell the application to terminate cleanly (or raise an exception
	if the NSApplication class is not linked).  Should allow ms-windows
	to get a mingw32-based GNUstep app to shut down cleanly.
	* Source/NSDistributedNotificationCenter.m: Rewrite code for connecting
	to and starting up daemon to handle the process more quickly and
	smoothly.  Only complain if we can't to connect to it even after
	launching it and retrying the connection for five seconds.

2005-11-16  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSProcessInfo.m:
	* Source/NSUserDefaults.m:

	* Source/NSException.m:
	* Source/NSObject.m:
	* Source/NSProcessInfo.m:
	* Source/NSString.m:

	Be consistent and access environment variables only via the
	NSProcessInfo class ...so a program which uses a category to
	override it can effectively change the environment safely.
	* Source/NSPathUtilities.m:
	Restructure code for gatting config, so that a single function
	can be used to get/set config information for the system or a
	user. Decrease code duplication.

2005-11-14  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/win32/GSFileHandleWin32.m: Move mingw32 implementation of
	file handle code here.

	was using.

2005-11-11  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/win32/NSMessagePortNameServerWin32.m: fix port lookup in case
	where named port does not exist.  Correct debug logging by class name.
	* Testing/nsconnection_client.m: don't run large structure test on
	mingw32 at present ... it crashes (something wrong with the invocation
	stuff for ffcall and some large structures on mingw32)
	* Tools/gdnc.m: Obey GSMailslot default on mingw32.
	* Source/NSDistributedNotificationCenter.m: ditto.
	* Source/win32/NSMessagePortWin32.m: Fixes for cases where requests
	we wanted to be async actually complete synchronously.  Moves the
	state of this code from pre-alpha to alpha/beta quality I guess.
	* Source/preface.m: Change declaration of variables to be pointer to
	char rather than array of char ... more usual/safe.

2005-11-10  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/win32/NSMessagePortWin32.m: more changes
	* Source/win32/NSMessagePortNameServerWin32.m: ditto
	Working at least in part (pre-alpha I guess) ... enable with the
	GSMailslot user default.  Known problems -
	1. no way of telling if the other end of a connection has gone until
	we try to write to it.
	2. hangup in my testing comms between three threads.

2005-11-08  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/win32/NSMessagePortWin32.m: Lots of work towards implementing

	* Source/win32/NSMessagePortNameServerWin32.m: ditto
	* Source/win32/NSUserDefaultsWin32.m: fix value type problem.
	* Source/win32/GNUmakefile: build NSMessagePortNameServer.

	* Source/NSMessagePort.m: Hide instance variables.  Use GSPortPrivate.h
	Add bugfix for possible deadlock situation reported by Wim.
	* Source/NSSocketPort.m: ditto
	* Source/NSMessagePortNameServer.m: Use GSPortPrivate.h
	* Source/NSPort.m: Implement missing informal protocol method.

2005-10-31  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/GSHTTPURLHandle.m: retain self for the duration of I/O
	handler methods where we may make callbacks to clients.  In case
	the client owns the handle, and decides to release it.
	* Source/GSFileHandle.m: Increase backlog size in listen() to improve
	perfromance of server objects accepting lots of connections.
	* Source/NSSocketPort.m: ditto ... though unlikely to be needed.
	* Source/NSMessagePort.m: ditto
	* Source/GSTcpPort.m: remove obsolete file
	* Tools/gstcpport_client.m: ditto
	* Tools/gstcpport_server.m: ditto

2005-10-30  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSLog.m: Apply patch #5399 from Jeremy Bettis.
	Tidy indentation. Fix variable declaration not at start of block
	(broke compile for older gcc versions).  Avoid repeated system
	calls to get process ID.
	* Headers/Additions/GNUstepBase/GSRunLoopCtxt.h: Move private header to
	Source directory.
	* Headers/Additions/GNUstepBase/GSRunLoopWatcher.h: ditto
	* Headers/Foundation/NSRunLoop.h: Add event type for handling windows
	messages.
	* Source/GNUmakefile: Don't install private headers in public area.
	* Source/win32/GSRunLoopCtxt.m: Add code to handle windows messages.
	Check number of handles waited for.  Avoid unnecessary heap memory
	allocation/release.
	* Source/win32/GSRunLoopWatcher.m: update header path.
	* Source/win32/NSRunLoopWin32.m: update header path.
	Deprecate addMsgTarget:withMethod:forMode: as our code for the original
	addEvent:type:watcher:forMode: can be much more efficient if we don't
	support that extension.  We need to use addEvent:type:watcher:forMode:
	if we want to implement NSMessagePort using windows messages.
	if we don't support that as well as the o
	* Source/win32/NSUserDefaultsWin32.m: update header path.

2005-10-29  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Tools/AGSHtml.m: Revert last change ... it looked OK but it broke
	internal checking of references.

2005-10-28  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Tools/gdomap.c: standardise on __MINGW32__
	* Source/win32/NSUserDefaultsWin32.m: patch #4567 fix a few typos
	* Source/DocMakefile: get right path for autogsdoc on mingw
	* Tools/DocMakefile: ditto (patch #4568)
	* Tools/AGSHtml.m: work round isssues with windows help (patch #4569)
	Mostly fixes by Jeremy Bettis

2005-10-27  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Tools/AGSParser.m: Fix error setting version numbers for the
	various standards.  Was causing generation of html erroneously
	saying that things were in neither openstep nor macos-x
	* configure.ac: Add code to initialise default path/config file
	information by loading GNUstep.conf config file from the location
	specified by config.make in the makefiles directory.
	Add --with-config-file= option to specify the name of the config
	file to be hard-coded into the library.  Overrides the value from
	the make system if desired.
	Add --with-default-config= option to specify the config file from
	which default path values are loaded (at configuration time). This
	overrides the default behavior of loading  values from the file
	specified by --with-config-file= or in $GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES/config.make
	Add --disable-importing-config-file for consistency with makefiles
	package ... not sure we need to keep this option.
	Add --disable-environment-config-file to prevent use of the
	GNUSTEP_CONFIG_FILE enviropnment variable.
	* configure: regenerate
	* Headers/Additions/GNUstepBase/config.h.in: regenerate to include
	new path definitions produced by configure script.
	* Source/GNUmakefile: Ignore variables specifying default paths,
	these are now set at configure time and can't be changed at make
	time.
	* SSL/GNUmakefile: ditto.
	* Source/NSPathUtilities.m: Remove windows-specific hack which
	got a few values from the registry ... we want to make use of
	the GNUstep.conf file simple/consistent across all platforms.
	Get default values from those defined in config.h

2005-10-26  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSPathUtilities.m: Drop 'make' style config file parsing
	and setting on 'sh' style (so we can source the config file).
	* Source/NSCalendarDate.m: Fix millisecond printing (bug #14863)

2005-10-25  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSPathUtilities.m: Try to ensure that user root and
	user library directories exist, so that tools/apps have somewhere
	to store any resources they don't want to put in the defaults
	database.

2005-10-23  Jeremy Bettis

	* Source/NSException.m: Added a few debugging checks in the
	exception handler code.
	The handler struct that needs to be removed is passed to
	_NSRemoveHandler.  Therefore, instead of starting at
	thread->_exception_handler and working your way down through
	the frames, you can just use the passed in struct. This way,
	if some bonehead called return in an NS_DURING block,
	perhaps you can still remove the exception handler without
	accessing memory that is on a freed section of the stack.

2005-10-23  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSString.m: remove test method for path handling setup,
	add environment variable (at least for a while until we are even
	more sure that there are no problems with do-the-right-thing mode).
	Remove previously deprecated path methods.
	* Source/NSFileManager.m: remove previously deprecated path method.
	* Headers/Foundation/NSString.h: Add missing information about
	windows peculiarities to comments.
	* Source/NSUserDefaults.m: More tweaks to use windows registry.
	also remove test user default for path handling setup.
	* Source/win32/NSUserDefaultsWin32.m: Rewrite
	* Source/NSPathUtilities.m: Tweaks for windows.
	Updates to (optionally) use windows registry to store defaults
	when GNUSTEP_USER_DEFAULTS_DIR is set to ':REGISTRY:'
	Based on patch #4299 by Jeremy Bettis, but with rewrites to make use
	of the code configurable in the GNUstep configuration file, to fix
	some bugs, and to conform to coding standards,  Probably still has
	bugs to fix, but seems usable now. 


2005-10-20  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSBundle.m (+pathsForResourcesOfType:inDirectory:,
	-pathsForResourcesOfType:inDirectory:forLocalization:):
	Implement.

2005-10-18  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSUserDefaults.m: Begin applying registry patch.
	* Source/win32/NSUserDefaultsWin32.m: Registry patch with
	some work done towards conforming to gnustep coding standards.

2005-10-17  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* SSL/GSSSLHandle.m: Don't output log/warning on accept/connect
	failure if it's just a timeout or disconnect.

2005-10-17  Fred Kiefer <FredKiefer@gmx.de>

	* Source/NSNumberFormatter.m
	(-getObjectValue:forString:errorDescription:,
	stringForObjectValue:): Respect the settings for decimal and
	thousands separators. Still a very basic implementation.

2005-10-17  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSPathUtilities.m: Simplify by removing options for
	redefining user home directories.  Add code to use gnumake format
	rather than shell format for config files.  Fix error in default
	setup of local root.

2005-10-17  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSPathUtilities.m: Changes to support relocation of the
	entire system simply by copying the directory containing it around.

2005-10-16  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSPathUtilities.m: Set default value for defaults directory
	(lost in last set of changes).

2005-10-15  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSPathUtilities.m: Fix retain/release error exposed by recent
	changes.  Rewrite config handling (work in progress ... keeping in
	sync with make package changes).
	* Documentation/base.gsdoc: update somewhat.
	* configure.ac: use GNUSTEP_CONFIG_FILE rather than
	GNUSTEP_CONFIGURATION_FILE ... for consistency with make.
	* Headers/Additions/GNUstepBase/config.h.in: ditto
	* configure: regenerate

2005-10-14  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSPathUtilities.m: Complete rewrite of config file parsing
	to try to make it consistent with the escaping and quoting conventions
	of shells, so the same file can be source'ed by /bin/sh

2005-10-13  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSPathUtilities.m: Remove some useless functions to clarify
	code.  Add some explanatory comments, make config file parsing a lot
	more robust.

2005-10-12  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* configure.ac (config_file): Get the location of the
	configuration file from gnustep-make rather than from a
	--with-config-file option.  Everything works exactly as before,
	but the --with-config-file option was moved to gnustep-make.
	* configure: Regenerated.

2005-10-12  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Headers/Foundation/NSPathUtilities.h: Remove deprecated functions.
	* Source/NSPathUtilities.m: Remove backward compatibility hacks for
	old GNUsteprc support.
	Remove deprecated functions.
	Permit specification of config file
	Simplify code a little.
	Fix a retain/release bug.
	Fix per-user .GNUsteprc parsing to work as documented (ie override
	the system-window config, not just fill in undefined values).
	Deprecate use of '~' in per-user .GNUsteprc ... it adds complexity
	for little utility that I can see ... we can undeprecate it if I'm
	wrong.
	* Documentation/Base.gsdoc: Update to remove references to old config
	scheme.  Remove documentation for deprecated '~' in per-user file
	Clarify how relative/absolute paths in config are treated.

2005-10-10  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSURLHandle.m: alter file handle to nitice if a file has
	changed.

2005-10-09  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Headers/Additions/GNUstepBase/GSFileHandle.h:

	* Source/NSFileManager.m:
	* Source/NSLog.m:
	* Source/NSRunLoop.m:
	* Source/NSSocketPort.m:
	* Source/NSTimeZone.m:
	Be consistent in usage of __WIN32__ and __MINGW__

2005-10-09  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSLog.m: We had complaints about the new code to log output
	to the windows event log on microsoft ... so this has been changed to
	be activated by the GSLogSyslog user default (as the windows event
	log is roughly analogous to syslog on unix) rather than being done
	by default.
	* Source/NSTimeZone.m:
	* Source/NSPathUtilities.m:
	Fix a few cases where 16bit chartacter strings were being used as 8bit
	under windows.

2005-10-07  Chris Vetter <cbv@gmx.net>

	* Source/NSPropertyList.m: Remove bogus newline generated for BOOL.

2005-10-06  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSPage.m: Add include for Cygwin (patch from
	Tom MacSween).

2005-10-04  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/GSTcpPort.m:
	* Source/NSCallBacks.m:
	* Source/NSMessagePort.m:
	* Source/NSMessagePortNameServer.m:
	* Source/NSSocketPort.m:
	* Source/win32/GSRunLoopCtxt.m:
	Attempt to deal with systems where sizeof(int) < sizeof(void*)

2005-10-01  David Ayers  <d.ayers@inode.at>

	* Source/NSString: (dataUsingEncoding:allowLossyConversion:):
	Use buffer returned by NSZoneRealloc to create the data object.
	
2005-09-29  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Headers/Additions/GNUstepBase/unicode/gsm0338.h: Map unicode
	no-break-space character to gsm space rather than to gsm escape
	character.

2005-09-28  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/Additions/GSMime.m: (-convertToBinary, -convertToBase64)
	new convenience methods for making documents compact or 7bit safe.

2005-09-25  David Ayers  <d.ayers@inode.at>

	* Testing/benchmark.m: Add some NSMapTable tests.

2005-09-23  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/Additions/GSMime.m: (-rawMimeData) tolerate nil content of
	document ... should produce output with empty body.

2005-09-18  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Version 1.11.1

2005-09-17  Saso Kiselkov <diablos@manga.sk>
        
        * Headers/Foundation/NSInvocation.h:
	* Source/NSInvocation.m:
        (-targetRetained, -retainArgumentsIncludingTarget:):
        Added new methods which allow target to be not retained when arguments 
        are and to check whether it is retained or not (-retainsArguments code
        moved in -retainArgumentsIncludingTarged and simplified by removing a 
        redundant nested branch statement).
        * Source/NSUndoManager.m (-forwardInvocation:, 
        -registerUndoWithTarget:selector:object:): Fixed bug #14488 by relying 
        on previous new methods to retain undo invocation (taking in account 
        the fact arguments may have been released before it is called).
        Patch committed by Quentin Mathe.

2005-09-01  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSSortDescriptor.m ([NSArray
	-sortedArrayUsingDescriptors:sortDescriptors]): Use
	makeImmutableCopyOnFail:.

2005-08-31  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/GNUmakefile: Install NSSortDescriptor.h 

2005-08-31  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSNumber.m: Improve poor hash function.

	* Headers/Foundation/NSSortDescriptor.h, Source/NSSortDescriptor.m:
	New files
	* Headers/Foundation/Foundation.h, Source/GNUmakefile: Add them to
	list.

2005-08-25  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSCalendarDate.m: Fix bug subtracting minute interval.
	* SSL/GSSSLHandle.m: Put handle in non-blocking mode before call
	to SSL_accept() or SSL_connect() so that we can be interrupted
	if the remote end doesn't respond (older code can hang waiting
	for the remote end).

2005-08-22  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSGeometry.m (NSStringFromPoint, NSStringFromRect,
	NSStringFromSize): Add spaces around '='. (Based on suggestion
	from Matthias Hengartner).

2005-08-12  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* configure.ac: Check if we can read the psinfo struct from 
	/proc (Solaris).
	* config/procfs.m4: Add psinfo check
	* config/config.psinfo.c: New file.
	* Source/NSProcessInfo.m (+load): Read from psinfo if we can.
	(Based on patch #4234 from Jeremy Bettis, with some modifications).

	* Source/GNUmakefile: Pass GNUSTEP_FLATTENED as preprocessor
	definitions when building.
	* Source/NSPathUtilities.m: Use GNUSTEP_FLATTENED and other
	definitions to fix bug in returning paths for non-flattened
	systems (code was previously returneing flattened paths
	irrespective of whether the system was configured flattened
	or not).

2005-07-30  Jeremy Bettis

	* Source/NSData.m: Support write to file for windows9x  users.

2005-07-27  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/Makefile.postamble (Info-gnustep.plist): Depend on 
	../Version.

2005-07-24  Jeremy Bettis

	* Source/NSCalendarDate.m: Fix bug adding interval to date.
	* Source/NSDebug.m: Implemented _NSNewStringFromCString() for gdb.
	* Source/GSFormat.m: Fix %S format.
	* Source/NSObject.m: ([conformsToProtocol:]) return NO if passed nul.
	* Source/NSBundle.m: be more tolerant.
	* Source/objc-load.m: Implemented objc_get_symbol_path() for windows.
	* Source/NSLog.m: On mingw write to debugger and event viewer.

2005-07-24  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSPathUtilities.m: Fix to avoid duplicate paths.
	Fix bug in order of application paths.

	* Source/Additions/GSXML.m: fix typo in contributed code for when
	the additions library is built standalone on MacOS-X
	* Source/GNUmakefile: Don't build base subprojects when only building
	additions library!

	mingw ifdefs
	* Tools/AGSHtml.h: Added defines for building without the gnustep
	base library.
	* Tools/gdnc.m: Fix minor documentation error.
	* Tools/gdnc.1: Fix minor documentation error and add documentation
	of flags to set public/network servers running.

2005-07-22  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSDate.m: ([isEqual:]),([isEqualToDate:]) change behavior to
	match current MacOS-X rather than OpenStep spec, as the old version
	was confusing and prevented dates being used as dictionary keys or
	stored in sets properly.

2005-07-21  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Version 1.11.0

2005-07-18  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSUnarchiver.m:
	* Source/NSPortCoder.m: Relax checking of decoded types information
	to allow int/long/longlong types to be decoded using 'i/l/q'
	interchangably and 'I/L'Q' interchangably because the compiler may
	use different encodings on different machines.

2005-07-15  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSProcessInfo.m: ([+initialize]) always check to see if
	things have already been initialised before doing the initialisation
	here.  Based on suggestion by Lloyd Dupont.

2005-07-14  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* SSL/GSSSLHandle.m: Retains self when running runloop to allow
	ssl connect and accept operations.  If the connect/accept takes
	a long time, the caller might give up and release the handle,
	causing resources to be freed and the ssl operation to crash.
	Retaining self (and noticing when a disconnect has taken place)
	prevents that.
	* Source/Additions/GSXML.m: Fix bug escaping emtities in fault
	message.

2005-07-13  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* Source/NSBundle.m: When building paths inside framework
	directories on Mingw (win32), don't add /Versions/%@; the new
	pseudo-framework support for Mingw does not support framework
	versioning.

2005-07-12  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* Source/NSBundle.m ([+_addFrameworkFromClass:]),
	([-executablePath]): Mangle/demangle framework names so that we
	can support '-' (and '+') in framework names.  Requires latest
	gnustep-make if you have a framework with '_', '-' or '+' in the
	name.

2005-07-08  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Testing/GNUmakefile, Testing/nsfilehandle.m: Minor fixes.
	
2005-07-08  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/objc-load.m: Under mingw print filenames for debug using
	%S rather than %s

2005-07-08  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	Recommit all gcc-4 changes ... I was unable to find a problem
	in them and have been running lots of stuff ok with them for several
	days now ... perhaps I made a mistake in thinking there was an issue.

2005-07-08  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSTask.m: Fix bug #13685 ... raise exception on an attempt
	to re-launch a task.

	* Bad day ... accidentally updated makefiles to build KVO stuff
	in last change ... so I might as well commit the partial
	implementation of NSKeyValueObserving.[hm]

2005-07-01  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* The last change passed regression tests etc, but one program
	I have has stopped working, so there is a bug somewhere.
	Reverted change until I can isolate the problem and fix it.

	Tweaks to avoid compiler warnings with gcc-4. Mostly signed pointer
	casts and bogus interface declarations to allow +class to be called
	on a class for which we don't have the real interface visible.

2005-07-01  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSException.m: ([-raise]) Fix behavior to be the same as in
	MacOS-X (ie call the default uncaught exception handler after
	whatever handler is set, in case the set handler does not terminate).
	Ensures that the -raise method cannot return.
	* Testing/basic.m: Add test for uncaught exception handler.

2005-06-30  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSSerializer.m: deserializeFromInfo() check that cross
	reference indices are valid and raise an exception if not ... should
	fix bug reported by Roland Schwingel, where trying to deserialize a
	corrupt file could cause a crash.

2005-06-28  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSInvocation.m (-getReturnValue:, -setReturnValue:): Only
	muck with size of buffer if we're using (deprecated) mframe.

2005-06-27  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSKeyedArchiver.m: Fix typo ... superClass should be
	superclass

2005-06-25  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/GSHTTPURLHandle.m:
	Preserve case of http headers when writing remote request, so that
	they can be tailored for remote servers which are buggy in having
	case sensitivity.
	When creating default http headers, capitalize the words in the
	header name, as this is the most common way headers are presented
	and documented, and thus the least likely to tickle case sensitivity
	bugs at the remote end of a connection.

2005-06-23  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/mframe.m (mframe_decode_return): Change return struct
	to fixed size to avoid gcc bug.

2005-06-23  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Headers/Foundation/NSObject.h:
	* Documentation/coding-standards.texi:

	Fixes bug #13842

2005-06-21  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSBundle.m: ([-initWithPath:]) expand paths with tildes.

2005-06-17  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSConnection.m: Removed bogus
	NSConnection(ConnectionDelegate) category .. these methods must not be
	implemented in NSObject.  I hope that removing the concrete
	implementation of the category from the Object class will not cause
	problems (I believe there used to be problems with older versions of
	the compiler if we tried to use @selector(NN) where NN was not
	implemented in the same code unit, but I can't remember what the
	problems were and when they occurred).
	* Headers/Foundation/NSConnection.h: Added comments/documentation from
	NSConnection.h

2005-06-17  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Remove objc/Protocol.h include from NSObject to avoid warnings
	with conflicting method signatures.
	* Headers/Foundation/NSConnection.h: Change Object categories
	to NSObject.
	* Source/NSConnection.m: Idem.
	* Headers/Foundation/NSObject.h: Don't include objc/Protocol.h
	add a few missing things.
	* Source/NSDate.m ([NSDate -isEqual:]): Use isKindOfClass.
	* Source/NSDistantObject.m, Source/NSProtocolChecker.m: 
	Include objc/Protocol.h

	end drops the connection.

2005-06-08  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSCalendardate.m: Fix crash when a nil string is passed to

	Add some constants for versions.
	* Tools/AGSParser.m: Support subminor version info
	* Tools/AGSHtml.m: ditto

2005-06-04  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Headers/Foundation/NSFileManager.h: hide private method in enumerator,
	swap one ivar for a new one keeping size the same.
	* Headers/Foundation/NSString.h: Mark some deprecated methods.
	* Source/GSFileHandle.m: Merge in win32 simplifications
	* Source/NSBundle.m: ditto

2005-06-04  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/GSFileHandle.m:
	* Source/NSFileManager.m:
	Define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS to be 64 so that, on unix-like systems which
	support large file handling (>2GB) the large file handling routines
	are used.
	* Source/NSTask.m: Try to deal with pipes properly when launching under
	windows.

	than explicitly define UINT_MAX.

2005-05-13  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/GSHTTPURLHandle.m: Minor improvement to detail of failure
	reason.

2005-05-11  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/GSFileHandle.m: Increase size of buffer for incoming data ...
	on modern systems we have more memory and a bugger buffer can make
	a significant performance improvement when reading large amounts of
	streamed data.  New define of READ_SIZE for this buffer ... easily
	adjusted in one place.

2005-05-10  Sheldon Gill <sheldon@westnet.net.au>
	* Resources/GNUmakefile
	* Resources/Languages/Locale.aliases
	* Resources/Spanish
	* Resources/Spanish.lproj/Localizable.strings

	* Tools/gsdoc-1_0_2.dtd:
	Support deprecation version as well as addition/removal.

2005-05-09  David Ayers  <d.ayers@inode.at>

	* Source/NSPropertyList.m (OAppend): Revert patch from
	2005-02-28.  It seems to fix the issue in the wrong place.
	Further investigation is necessary.
	
2005-05-09  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Tools/AGSHtml.m: Output 'Releases' rather than 'Standards' as it
	seems a better term for API version information.
	* Tools/AGSParser.h:
	* Tools/AGSParser.m: Parse OS_API_VERSION() and GS_API_VERSION() to
	produce detailed version information.
	* Headers/Foundation/NSObject.h: defines of the two version macros for
	proof of concept.

2005-05-08  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Tools/AGSHtml.h: Support versioning info instead of standards
	* Tools/AGSHtml.m: ditto
	* Tools/AGSOutput.m: ditto
	* Tools/AGSParser.m: ditto
	* Tools/GNUmakefile: Add new dtd and remove old tool.

	* Tools/gsdoc-1_0_2.dtd: ditto
	* Tools/gsdoc.m: Remove obsolete tool.
	* Tools/gsdoc.gsdoc: Updated
	Changes to support OpenStep/OPENSTEP/MacOS-X versioning and
	GNUstep versioning, using add/rem attributes to specify the
	version at which a feature was added to or removed from the
	API.  Drop the old 'standards' mechanism which was too rigid
	for detailed versioning.

2005-05-08 14:11 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSPropertyList.m: Corrected setup so that compilation 
	works on Solaris 9.

	* Source/NSString.m: nul terminate properly when a returned 'C string'
	is actually unicode.
	* Source/GSString.m: ditto.

2005-05-08  Fred Kiefer <FredKiefer@gmx.de>

	* Source/NSPropertyList.m: Added class BinaryPLGenerator to export
	property lists in Apple binary format.

	(+ propertyList:isValidForFormat:) Report
	NSPropertyListBinaryFormat_v1_0 as a supported format.
	(GSBinaryPLParser -initWithData:mutability:) Read table start correctly.
	(GSBinaryPLParser -objectAtIndex:) Better support for numbers.
	
2005-05-07  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/Additions/GSMime.m: Improve handling of text/xml without
	a charset.  Add new method to determine the correct charset in the
	case where it has to be inferred from the actual data.  Follow the
	instructions in http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/ but be a bit more
	tolerant. (ebcdic not supported).
	* Headers/Foundation/GSString.m: Add a few new methods from macosx.
	* Source/NSString.m: ditto.
	* Source/GSString.m: ditto.

2005-05-04  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/Additions/GSMime.m: If given content of type text/xml without
	a charset, try to get the charset from the encoding="..." part of the
	header.

2005-04-29  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/GSHTTPURLHandle.m: Remove self as an observer of our file
	handle on deallocation ... prevent notfications being sent to
	deallocated object.

2005-04-28  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Documentation/coding-standards.texi: Added what appear to be the
	generally accepted parts of Sheldon's suggested coding standards
	additions.
	* Source/GSHTTPURLHandle.m: Modified to keep watching idle connections
	and handle things properly when the remote end drops the connection.
	Should fix occasional trouble when connectioin keepalive is used but
	the remote host drops the connection between requests.

2005-04-26  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/GSHTTPURLHandle.m: remove wProperties and wData from
	handle in sync.

2005-04-25  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Tools/defaults.m: Fix bug writing defaults whose values should be
	quoted strings.

2005-04-23  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSData.m: Fix bug in memory management when serializing an
	object over 65K in length.

2005-04-20  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSConnection.m:
	* Source/NSDistributedNotificationCenter.m:
	* Tools/gdnc.m:
	mingw tweaks

2005-04-19  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Tools/gdomap.c (init_iface): Round size to make sure we don't violate
	pointer alignment boundaries.

2005-04-14  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/Additions/GSMime.m: Add tweak to cope with buggy mailers
	which insert space after the boundary in a multipart document.

2005-04-13  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* ANNOUNCE, NEWS, Documentation/news.texi,
	Documentation/ReleaseNotes.gsdoc: Merge in release info from
	1.10.3 release branch.

2005-04-12  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Headers/Foundation/NSDistributedNotificationCenter.h:
	Added GSPublicNotificationCenterType and changed documentation for
	NSLocalNotificationCenterType to say it's private to the current user.
	* Source/NSDistributedNotificationCenter.m: Changed so that
	NSLocalNotificationCenterType is MacOS-X compatible and the new
	GSPublicNotificationCenterType works like our old implementation.
	* Source/NSPortNameServer.m: Add detailed message about forthcoming
	change to make the default port name server deal with message ports
	rather than socket ports ... for MacOS-X compatibility and security.
	* Source/externs.m: Added GSPublicNotificationCenterType
	* Tools/gdnc.m: Changes for new NSDistributedNotificationCenter
	behavior.
	Overview ... updated distributed notifications to be private to the
	owner of the processes by default.  Added one-time warning message
	for developers that NSConnection will be changing the same way.
	These changes discussed a year or two ago (mostly with Alexander),
	but nobody ever actually implemented them.
	* Source/NSPathUtilities.m: Make temporary directory name based on
	uid so that it is consistent on a unix system where there are
	multiple named accounts with the same user id (essentially all
	aliases for a single account).

2005-04-05  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* gnustep-base.spec.in: Update make dependancy

2005-04-05  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSString.m: ([sttringByAppendingPathComponent:]) Fix bug
	eliding multiple slashes in path.

2005-04-02  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSTask.m: Fix missing nul terminator to arguments under win32

2005-04-01  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSBundle.m: Minor debug/warning log tweaks.
	* Headers/Foundation/NSBundle.h: Document differences between GNUstep
	and MacOS-X when initialising using a relative path.
	* Headers/NSString.h: Fix typo in comment.

2005-03-31  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* ANNOUNCE, NEWS, Documentation/news.texi,
	Documentation/ReleaseNotes.gsdoc: Merge in release info from
	1.10.2 release branch.

2005-03-31  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSBundle.m (_find_framework): New function.
	([NSBundle +_addFrameworkFromClass:]): Use it. Based on patch
	from Sheldon Gill.

2005-03-31  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSString.m: (isAbsolutePath) always treat a path beginning
	with '/' as absolute except when in windows mode or on windows and
	not in unix mode.  Treat all UNC paths as absolute ... a change made
	after a lot of trawling the web and looking at examples of UNC path
	usage.

2005-03-23  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* config/pathxml.m4: Fix to get --with-xml-prefix= to work for
	xml2-config
	* configure: regenerated

2005-03-22  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/Additions/GSMime.m: Fix some charset-encoding mappings.
	Add utf-7 and utf-16.
	Add all aliases for ascii and latin1
	Document mapping methods better.

2005-03-21  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Headers/Foundation/NSFileManager.h: Add path handling documentation.
	* Headers/Foundation/NSString.h: Add path handling methods
	documentation and new method to set global path handling mode.
	* Source/NSUserDefaults.m: Update path handling mode when defaults
	are read in.
	* Source/NSString.m: Implement selectable path handling mode ...
	gnustep/unix/windows.  In the default gnustep mode we try to
	handle paths in any format and just do the right thing.
	Also updated handling of path extensions to match MacOSX behavior.
	* Source/Additions/GSMime.m: Remove deprecated method.
	Optimise a little by avoiding class lookups.

2005-03-18  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSPathUtilities.m: Use fprintf rather than NSLog to try to
	avoid possible recursion when errors occur.

2005-03-17  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSPathUtilities.m: Tidy variable and function names to fit
	GNUstep conventions.  Simplify code a little.  Don't attempt to parse
	per-user config file if its name is nil or empty string.
	Support parsing old config options for backward compatibility.

2005-03-15  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/Additions/GSMime.m: Ensure last line of base64 encoded data
	is terminated with crlf for clients which have buggy base64 decodedrs.

2005-03-15  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/Additions/GSMime.m: Mark ([setDefaultEncoding:]) as deprecated
	rather than just removing it ... in case someone has started using it.
	* Source/NSPathUtilities.m: Tidied a little ... moved a function.
	* Headers/Additions/GNUstepBase/GSFunctions.h: New header for functions
	* Headers/Foundation/NSPathUtilities.h: Moved function
	* Source/DocMakefile: Include GSFunctions.h
	* Source/GNUmakefile: ditto
	* Source/Additions/GNUmakefile: Build GSFunctions.m
	* Source/Additions/GSFunctions.m: New file for extra functions.
	* Source/NSString.m: ([stringByExpandingTildeInPath]) Improve handling
	of paths containing mingw drives.
	* Source/NSDate.m: Use same values for distant past/future as MacOSX
	* Source/NSCalendarDate.m: Support output of extreme year values.

2005-03-14  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Continuation of NSPathUtilities patches
	* configure.ac: Add config-file option
	* Headers/Foundation/NSPathUtilities.h: Add GSFindNamedFile, more 
	NSSearchPathDirectory enums.
	* Source/GNUmakefile: Don't install Win32 headers.
	* Source/NSPathUtilities.m (InitializePathUtilities, ...): Add
	support for reading standard path locations from a configuration
	file. Various support functions added/removed to fit.
	(GSFindNamedFile): New function.
	(GSSetUserName): Do nothing if the user is the same.
	(NSHomeDirectoryForUser): Use Windows utilities to get user name
	(on Windows, of course).
	(NSFullUserName): Default to NSUserName on Windows.
	(GSSystemRootDirectory): Mark as deprecated.
	(GSDefaultsRootForUser): Correctly return the actual defaults
	directory, not the user directory.
	(GSStandardPathPrefixes): Mark as deprecated.
	(NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains): Add platform paths and
	additional search directories.
	* Source/NSUserDefaults (pathForUser): Correct use of
	GSDefaultsRootForUser. Remove obsolete path checking and
	defaults location checking. (Patches from Sheldon Gill
	with some modifications).

	* Documentation/Base.gsdoc: Update documentation.
	* Headers/Additions/GNUstepBase/Win32_Utilities.h,
	Source/win32/Win32_Utilities.m: Fix function arguments.

2005-03-12  Sungjin Chun <chuns@embian.com>

	* Source/Additions/GSXML.m: Port to MacOS-X

2005-03-11  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSPropertyList.m: Handle null object passed to OAppend()
	* Source/Additions/GSMime.m: Optimise setDefaultCharset: a little
	Add error checking to setDefaultEncoding: to make sure it sets a
	valid characterset encoding. Should almost certainly remove this
	method though ... as it duplicates setDefaultCharset: functionality
	in a somewhat less useful form.

2005-03-11  David Wetzel <dave@turbocat.de>
        * Source/Additions/GSMime.m:
        * Headers/Additions/GNUstepBase/GSMime.h
          Added setDefaultEncoding:
          This is needed in GSWeb if you use utf-8 and faster than using a
          String as encoding name.

2005-03-09  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSCharacterSet.m: Fix bug in forming union ... was using
	wrong length.

2005-03-08  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSCharacterSetData.h: Add data outside unicode base plane.
	* Source/NSCharacterSet.m: Change to support all unicode characters
	rather than just UTF16.  The current implementation is still based
	on (often much larger than before) bitmaps.  It may be that the size
	of the bitmap data is too large for real world use, and we may have
	to introduce a different storage mechanism.  The current mechanism
	is good for cases where the number of characters in the set is large
	and those characters are scattered, or where characters are only
	present in the base plane.  Another implementation might be better
	for cases where characters are clustered into contiguous groups
	and the groups are scattered through the full range.

2005-03-07  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Headers/Additions/GNUstepBase/GSConfig.h.in: Extra types
	* configure.ac: Added types for GSConfig.h.in
	* configure: regenerated
	* Headers/Foundation/NSCharacterSet.h: New MacOS-X methods
	* Headers/Foundation/NSIndexSet.h: Remove bogus comment.
	* Source/GNUmakefile: Don't build NSBitmapCharSet.m
	* Source/NSBitmapCharSet.h: Removed ... merege into NSCharacterSet.m
	* Source/NSBitmapCharSet.m: ditto
	* Source/NSCharacterSet.m: Optimise a few methods.
	Add new MacOS-X methods (naive implementations)
	Merge in NSBitmapCharSet as private class

2005-03-06  Matt Rice <ratmice@yahoo.com>

	* Headers/Foundation/NSRunLoop.h: Reorder RunLoopEventType for binary
	compatibility.

2005-03-06  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Headers/Foundation/NSCharacterSet.h: Add documentation and method
	([-capitalizedLetterCharacterSet]) Change name of symbol set to
	match MacOS-X
	* Source/NSCharacterSet.m: Add new method and move documentation to
	header.  Include local NSCharacterSetData.h for bitmap data.
	* Source/NSCharacterSetData.h: New file containing the bitmap data
	for the standard charactersets.  Generated by dev-apps/charsets
	tools using the latest unicode characterset data today.
	* Source/NSCharacterSets/README.CharSet: mark as obsolete.
	* Source/GNUmakefile: No longer build/install NSCharacterSets
	The standard bitmap data for charactersets is now built in to
	NSCharacterSet.
	* Headers/Foundation/NSBitmapChar.h: Moved nonstandard header
	to private source directory.
	* Source/NSAutoreleasePool.m: Rewrite deallocation to cause the pool
	to remain as the current pool during the deallocation process ...
	Requires deallocation to be done in a loop to avoid possible leaks
	etc if an object which is being deallocated decides to autorelease
	something.
	Also removed a few private methods for simplification.

2005-03-04  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

2005-03-02  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Headers/Foundation/NSKeyValueCoding.h:
	* Source/NSArray.m:
	* Source/NSKeyValueCoding.m:
	* Source/Additions/GSObjCRuntime.m:
	On the way back from FOSDEM I updated tje key-value-coding stuff to
	match the lastest version from Apple/MacOS-X panther.
	I don't use KVC in my code, and have not testcases for it, so would
	appreciate it if anyone who does could try this out and get bug
	reports back to me ASAP.

2005-03-01  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSBundle.m (+gnustepBundle, 
	+pathForGNUstepResource:ofType:inDirectory:]): Add deprecated
	log message.
	* Source/NSNotificationQueue.m, Source/null-load.h: 
	Fix copyright message.

2005-03-01 02:50 Nicola Pero <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* Source/Makefile.preamble (ADDITIONAL_LIB_DIRS): When building a
	shared library, depend on all TARGET_SYSTEM_LIBS, not just
	CONFIG_SYSTEM_LIBS.
	* Headers/Additions/GNUstepBase/GSObjCRuntime.h: Do not use
	__declspec(dllexport) on mingw.  Use extern instead.
	
2005-02-28 17:45 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* NSCharacterSets/GNUmakefile: Use GNUSTEP_OBJ_DIR_NAME to run
	data conversion tool, since Tom Koelman points out that the 'obj'
	subdirectory does not work on windoze due to lack of symlinks.

2005-02-28 17:10 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSAutoreleasePool.m:
	* Source/NSCharacterSet.m:
	* Source/NSproxy.m:
	Damn ... when I ran the testsuite for the stuff I did at fosdem, it
	all worked ... but now I find that it was linking to an older version
	of the base library and actually the changes were broken.
	The new modifications should (hopefully) fix all breakage.
	The changes exposed rare bugs in the existing code ...
	NSCharacterSet was returning immutable copies of the standard
	character sets when it should return mutable ones, it was also
	being a bit bad about allocating new instances.  NSProxy was
	failing to implement instanceMethodForSelector:, and NSAutoreleasePool
	had a bug which could mess up a bit if the objects being deallocated
	by it autoreleased anything.

2005-02-28  David Ayers  <d.ayers@inode.at>

	* Source/NSPropertyList.m (OAppend): Attempt to transform
	description of non-proporty-list objects into property list
	before recursing for OPENSTEP compatibility.
	
2005-02-27 13:20 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSConnection.m:
	Set default timeouts to maximum timeouts for MacOS-X compatibility.

2005-02-27 08:45 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* NSCharacterSets/dataToheader.c: new file to convert data files to
	constant values in a new header (NSCharacterSetData.h).
	* NSCharacterSets/GNUmakefile: build header from data files, and
	don't create resource set, since we no longer use the files at runtime.
	* Source/NSCharacterSet.m: include NSCharacterSetData.h and use it to
	create the standard charactersets rather than reading from data files.
	This has two advantages - It avoids the need to install characterset
	data files with the library, and it means that we have characterset
	data available immediately (before we need to access the filesystem)
	so we can use charactersets and NSString methods which depend upon them
	earlier on in the system initialisation.

2005-02-27 00:50 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSAutoreleasePool.m: ([-dealloc]) cache method implementations
	for release calls on the assumption that many of the objects in the
	pool will be of the same class.
	Optimisation suggested by Georg Wallmann

2005-02-23  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* configure.ac: Add test to check for poll emulation
	* Source/NSRunLoop.h: Don't use poll if we're just emulating.
	* Source/unix/GSRunLoopCtxt.m: Idem.

2005-02-23 14:00 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/unix/Makefile.preamble:
	* Source/win32/GNUmakefile:
	* Source/win32/GSRunLoopCtxt.m:
	* Source/win32/GSRunLoopWatcher.m:
	* Source/win32/Makefile.preamble:
	* Source/win32/NSRunLoopWin32.m:
	Applied patch by Luis Cabellos to use native win32 event handling
	rather than unix style select/poll on a win32 system.
	Rewrote various chunks to simplify, conform to coding standards,
	work for me etc.  In particular, replaced code for thread
	synchronisation to use win32 Event rather than pipe.

2005-02-22  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Branched freeze-1_10_2 for Version: 1.10.2

2005-02-22 14:00 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Documentation/Base.gsdoc:
	* Source/GSPrivate.h:
	* Source/NSDebug.m:
	* Source/NSLog.m:
	* Source/NSUserDefaults.m:
	Add GSLogThread to include thread id in NSLog() and debug output.
	* Source/NSMessagePort.m:
	* Source/NSSocketPort.m:
	Remove thread reporting in some debug statements as it can be
	done universally using GSLogThread.

2005-02-22 11:12 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/GSFFCallInvocation.m:
	* Source/GSFormat.m:
	* Source/GSString.m:
	* Source/GSTemplateValue.m:
	* Source/NSAutoreleasePool.m:
	* Source/NSData.m:

	* Source/Additions/GSCategories.m:
	* Source/Additions/GSObjCRuntime.m:
	* Source/Additions/Unicode.m:
	* Source/Additions/behavior.m:
	Tidy up use of white space a little.

2005-02-21 20:30 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/GSFormat.m: Modified code to rewrite output to use correct
	decimal separator for locale (hopefully).  Also made a small
	performance improvement in processing digits for output.

2005-02-21 14:30 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/GSFormat.m:
	* Source/NSConnection.m:
	* Source/callframe.m:
	* Source/cifframe.m:
	Include malloc.h for systems where it is needed for alloca()
	* Tools/gdomap.c: Avoid some warnings on mingw32

2005-02-21 14:10 Stefan Urbanek <stefan@agentfarms.net>

	* Source/NSAttributedString.m: Fix loop decoding from archive.

2005-02-18 06:20 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSString.m: Tidy up some of last patch for unicode filesystem
	support.
	* Source/NSFileManager.m: Complete rewrite of  unicode filesystem
	support to make code more readable and to allow it to easily be
	turned off by commenting out the 'UNICODE' and '_UNICODE'
	definitions at the start of the file.
	There is a bug in the mingw runtime which is (currently) still
	distributed in the 'current' complete mingw distribution ... which
	breaks unicode filesystem support very badly.
	So ... you can now either revert to 8bit charset filesystem support,
	or download a more recent version of the mingw runtime from the
	mingw site.
	* Source/NSTask.m: Fix setting environment for mingw ... use own
	method to get environment rather than examining instance variable,
	as the variable may not be set.  Sort variables because windows needs
	them in alphabetical order.  Fix conversion to unicode.

	2005-02-16 14:40 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* config/patchxml.m4: Try to detect libxml2 in standard directories
	exen if xml2-config is not present.
	* configure.ac: Detect libxml2 becore iconv, in case libxml2
	requires iconv (which it usually will on a system where iconv is
	not built into the standard c library).
	* confingure: Regenerate
	* Source/Additions/GSXML.m: Set memory allocation functions to be
	used by libxml2, so we can use objc_free() to release strings returned
	by the library, and avoid linker problem with xmlFree() on mingw.

2005-02-15 08:00 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSTask.m: Fix incorrect version comitted.

2005-02-14 08:00 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSTask.m: Pass environment settings for mingw based on
	anonymous bug submission (bug #11360)
	* Source/NSUser.m: Fix bug #11378
	* Tools/gdomap.c: Quote mingw arguments toi fix bug #11854
	* Documentation/manual/Introduction.texi: Apply patch by pupeno
	(bug #11814)

2005-02-10 01:05  Alexander Malmberg  <alexander@malmberg.org>

	* Tools/gdnc.m (main): Remove the program name from the arguments
	given to the new task.

2005-02-08 11:20 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSString.m: (unicodeString) rewrite to conform to coding
	standards and to be more efficient.

2005-02-08 10:10 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Tools/gdnc.m: Rewrite startup code to create a daemon using NSTask
	rather than calling fork()/spawn() etc.
	Make arguments more consistent with gpbs
	* Source/NSTask.m: Minor code layout/indentation tweaks.

2005-02-02 09:40 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSFileManager.m: Restructure last patch to conform to
	gnustep coding standards.
	(localFromOpenStepPath:) for unix paths, expand '~' abbreviations.

2005-01-31  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Documentation/coding-standards.texi: Add section of documentation.

2005-01-29 03:46 Matt Rice <ratmice@yahoo.com>
	
	* Source/NSUndoManager.m (-registerUndoWithTarget:selector:object:):
	Have the invocation to retain it's arguments. (Fixes bug #4692.)

2005-01-21 22:08 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: [NSUndoManager redo] and 
	[NSUndoManager undoNestedGroup] moved the call to actionName
	to a later point in both methods to get the name from the 
	"groupToRedo" or the "groupToUndo" respectively.  This 
	corrects the issue with the wrong name sometimes appearing
	in the redo/undo menu items.

2005-01-16 07:59 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: Added code to properly set the
	name of the action when undo/redo is called. 

2005-01-16 06:37 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: Check if the group is nil in 
	endUndoGrouping before checking the count.

2005-01-15 06:17 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: Undid previous change here.

2005-01-15 06:13 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: Localized undo/redo menu title.

2005-01-14 06:50 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: Correction for redo.

2005-01-14 05:43 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: Fix forward invocation to not add
	a group when it doesn't contain any actions. 

2005-01-08  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSCalendarDate.m: fix time zone for %z format with 
	only 2 digits in -initWithString:calendarFormat:locale:	

2005-01-07  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSTimeZone.m (+abbreviationDictionary): Retain	dictionary
	(Fixes bug #11516).
