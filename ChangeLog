	* Headers/Foundation/NSCharacterSet.h: Add documentation and method
	([-capitalizedLetterCharacterSet])
	* Source/NSCharacterSet.m: Add new method and move documentation to
	header.  Include local NSCharacterSetData.h for bitmap data.

	for the standard charactersets.  Generated by dev-apps/charsets
	tools using the latest unicode characterset data today.
	* Source/NSCharacterSets/README.CharSet: mark as obsolete.
	* Source/GNUmakefile: No longer build/install NSCharacterSets
	The standard bitmap data for charactersets is now built in to
	NSCharacterSet.

2005-03-02  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Headers/Foundation/NSKeyValueCoding.h:
	* Source/NSArray.m:
	* Source/NSKeyValueCoding.m:
	* Source/Additions/GSObjCRuntime.m:
	On the way back from FOSDEM I updated tje key-value-coding stuff to
	match the lastest version from Apple/MacOS-X panther.
	I don't use KVC in my code, and have not testcases for it, so would
	appreciate it if anyone who does could try this out and get bug
	reports back to me ASAP.

2005-03-01  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSBundle.m (+gnustepBundle, 
	+pathForGNUstepResource:ofType:inDirectory:]): Add depreciated
	log message.
	* Source/NSNotificationQueue.m, Source/null-load.h: 
	Fix copyright message.

2005-03-01 02:50 Nicola Pero <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* Source/Makefile.preamble (ADDITIONAL_LIB_DIRS): When building a
	shared library, depend on all TARGET_SYSTEM_LIBS, not just
	CONFIG_SYSTEM_LIBS.
	* Headers/Additions/GNUstepBase/GSObjCRuntime.h: Do not use
	__declspec(dllexport) on mingw.  Use extern instead.
	
2005-02-28 17:45 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* NSCharacterSets/GNUmakefile: Use GNUSTEP_OBJ_DIR_NAME to run
	data conversion tool, since Tom Koelman points out that the 'obj'
	subdirectory does not work on windoze due to lack of symlinks.

2005-02-28 17:10 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSAutoreleasePool.m:
	* Source/NSCharacterSet.m:
	* Source/NSproxy.m:
	Damn ... when I ran the testsuite for the stuff I did at fosdem, it
	all worked ... but now I find that it was linking to an older version
	of the base library and actually the changes were broken.
	The new modifications should (hopefully) fix all breakage.
	The changes exposed rare bugs in the existing code ...
	NSCharacterSet was returning immutable copies of the standard
	character sets when it should return mutable ones, it was also
	being a bit bad about allocating new instances.  NSProxy was
	failing to implement instanceMethodForSelector:, and NSAutoreleasePool
	had a bug which could mess up a bit if the objects being deallocated
	by it autoreleased anything.

2005-02-28  David Ayers  <d.ayers@inode.at>

	* Source/NSPropertyList.m (OAppend): Attempt to transform
	description of non-proporty-list objects into property list
	before recursing for OPENSTEP compatibility.
	
2005-02-27 13:20 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSConnection.m:
	Set default timeouts to maximum timeouts for MacOS-X compatibility.

2005-02-27 08:45 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* NSCharacterSets/dataToheader.c: new file to convert data files to
	constant values in a new header (NSCharacterSetData.h).
	* NSCharacterSets/GNUmakefile: build header from data files, and
	don't create resource set, since we no longer use the files at runtime.
	* Source/NSCharacterSet.m: include NSCharacterSetData.h and use it to
	create the standard charactersets rather than reading from data files.
	This has two advantages - It avoids the need to install characterset
	data files with the library, and it means that we have characterset
	data available immediately (before we need to access the filesystem)
	so we can use charactersets and NSString methods which depend upon them
	earlier on in the system initialisation.

2005-02-27 00:50 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSAutoreleasePool.m: ([-dealloc]) cache method implementations
	for release calls on the assumption that many of the objects in the
	pool will be of the same class.
	Optimisation suggested by Georg Wallmann

2005-02-23  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* configure.ac: Add test to check for poll emulation
	* Source/NSRunLoop.h: Don't use poll if we're just emulating.
	* Source/unix/GSRunLoopCtxt.m: Idem.

2005-02-23 14:00 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/win32/GNUmakefile:
	* Source/win32/GSRunLoopCtxt.m:
	* Source/win32/GSRunLoopWatcher.m:
	* Source/win32/Makefile.preamble:
	* Source/win32/NSRunLoopWin32.m:
	Applied patch by Luis Cabellos to use native win32 event handling
	rather than unix style select/poll on a win32 system.
	Rewrote various chunks to simplify, conform to coding standards,
	work for me etc.  In particular, replaced code for thread
	synchronisation to use win32 Event rather than pipe.

2005-02-22 14:00 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Documentation/Base.gsdoc:
	* Source/GSPrivate.h:
	* Source/NSDebug.m:
	* Source/NSLog.m:
	* Source/NSUserDefaults.m:
	Add GSLogThread to include thread id in NSLog() and debug output.
	* Source/NSMessagePort.m:
	* Source/NSSocketPort.m:
	Remove thread reporting in some debug statements as it can be
	done universally using GSLogThread.

	* Source/Additions/behavior.m:
	Tidy up use of white space a little.

2005-02-21 20:30 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/GSFormat.m: Modified code to rewrite output to use correct
	decimal separator for locale (hopefully).  Also made a small
	performance improvement in processing digits for output.

2005-02-21 14:30 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/GSFormat.m:
	* Source/NSConnection.m:
	* Source/callframe.m:
	* Source/cifframe.m:
	Include malloc.h for systems where it is needed for alloca()

2005-02-21 14:10 Stefan Urbanek <stefan@agentfarms.net>

	* Source/NSAttributedString.m: Fix loop decoding from archive.

2005-02-18 06:20 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSString.m: Tidy up some of last patch for unicode filesystem
	support.
	* Source/NSFileManager.m: Complete rewrite of  unicode filesystem
	support to make code more readable and to allow it to easily be
	turned off by commenting out the 'UNICODE' and '_UNICODE'
	definitions at the start of the file.
	There is a bug in the mingw runtime which is (currently) still
	distributed in the 'current' complete mingw distribution ... which
	breaks unicode filesystem support very badly.
	So ... you can now either revert to 8bit charset filesystem support,
	or download a more recent version of the mingw runtime from the
	mingw site.
	* Source/NSTask.m: Fix setting environment for mingw ... use own
	method to get environment rather than examining instance variable,
	as the variable may not be set.  Sort variables because windows needs
	them in alphabetical order.  Fix conversion to unicode.

	2005-02-16 14:40 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* config/patchxml.m4: Try to detect libxml2 in standard directories
	exen if xml2-config is not present.
	* configure.ac: Detect libxml2 becore iconv, in case libxml2
	requires iconv (which it usually will on a system where iconv is
	not built into the standard c library).
	* confingure: Regenerate
	* Source/Additions/GSXML.m: Set memory allocation functions to be
	used by libxml2, so we can use objc_free() to release strings returned
	by the library, and avoid linker problem with xmlFree() on mingw.

2005-02-15 08:00 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSTask.m: Fix incorrect version comitted.

2005-02-14 08:00 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSTask.m: Pass environment settings for mingw based on
	anonymous bug submission (bug #11360)
	* Source/NSUser.m: Fix bug #11378
	* Tools/gdomap.c: Quote mingw arguments toi fix bug #11854
	* Documentation/manual/Introduction.texi: Apply patch by pupeno
	(bug #11814)

2005-02-10 01:05  Alexander Malmberg  <alexander@malmberg.org>

	* Tools/gdnc.m (main): Remove the program name from the arguments
	given to the new task.

2005-02-08 11:20 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSString.m: (unicodeString) rewrite to conform to coding
	standards and to be more efficient.

2005-02-08 10:10 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Tools/gdnc.m: Rewrite startup code to create a daemon using NSTask
	rather than calling fork()/spawn() etc.
	Make arguments more consistent with gpbs
	* Source/NSTask.m: Minor code layout/indentation tweaks.

2005-02-02 09:40 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSFileManager.m: Restructure last patch to conform to
	gnustep coding standards.
	(localFromOpenStepPath:) for unix paths, expand '~' abbreviations.

2005-01-31  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Documentation/coding-standards.texi: Add section of documentation.

2005-01-29 03:46 Matt Rice <ratmice@yahoo.com>
	
	* Source/NSUndoManager.m (-registerUndoWithTarget:selector:object:):
	Have the invocation to retain it's arguments. (Fixes bug #4692.)

2005-01-21 22:08 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: [NSUndoManager redo] and 
	[NSUndoManager undoNestedGroup] moved the call to actionName
	to a later point in both methods to get the name from the 
	"groupToRedo" or the "groupToUndo" respectively.  This 
	corrects the issue with the wrong name sometimes appearing
	in the redo/undo menu items.

2005-01-16 07:59 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: Added code to properly set the
	name of the action when undo/redo is called. 

2005-01-16 06:37 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: Check if the group is nil in 
	endUndoGrouping before checking the count.

2005-01-15 06:17 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: Undid previous change here.

2005-01-15 06:13 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: Localized undo/redo menu title.

2005-01-14 06:50 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: Correction for redo.

2005-01-14 05:43 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSUndoManager.m: Fix forward invocation to not add
	a group when it doesn't contain any actions. 

2005-01-08  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSCalendarDate.m: fix time zone for %z format with 
	only 2 digits in -initWithString:calendarFormat:locale:	

2005-01-07  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSTimeZone.m (+abbreviationDictionary): Retain	dictionary
	(Fixes bug #11516).
