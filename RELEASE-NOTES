We are now using the latest Objective C runtime patches from Scott
Christley.  Unfortunately, they runtime changes and the corresponding
required GNUstep Base Library changes are not compatible with the old
runtime.  That is, you must install the new runtime patches in order
to compile this version of the GNUstepBase Library.




Each thread now has their own exception handler and assertion handler.
(I haven't tested the assertion handler, though it should probably
work).

The biggest change with this patch is that the zone functions use
objc_malloc() to get more memory and that the default zone can be set
by the user with NSSetDefaultMallocZone().

I've extended the functionality of zones.  Now one can obtain memory
statistics and also check for integrity.  There is also more detailed
documentation, which I've sent in a separate message.
