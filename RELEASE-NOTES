We are now using the latest Objective C runtime patches from Scott
Christley.  Unfortunately, they runtime changes and the corresponding
required GNUstep Base Library changes are not compatible with the old
runtime.  That is, you must install the new runtime patches in order
to compile this version of the GNUstepBase Library.
