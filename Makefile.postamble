# Automatically run ./configure if needed to generate the makefiles
# which we need in order to do our job.  If you need any special
# argument to ./configure, you can't rely on this rule, and you must
# always run ./configure manually.  This rule is usually executed
# whenever 'make xxx' is invoked after a 'make distclean' - which is
# why we can't guess what the ./configure arguments were last time
# ./configure was called - make distclean cleans the sources
# completely, wiping out any memory of specific configuration.
