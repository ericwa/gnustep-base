The source code here is obsolete - mostly from the original libObjects library
that was used as a basis for GNUstep-base.  The GNUstep base library has been
almost entirely rewritten since this code was used!

The files have been preserved in case we want to use them at some point,
as the basis/inspiration for an additional library.

They are NOT part of GNUstep-base proper and are not supported in any way,
they are also unlikely to be preserved indefinately, and will probably be
removed from the CVS repository at some point.
