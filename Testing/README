These tests are mostly just samples of code that developers put together
to do quick checks to make sure things are working. This is not a
comprehensive test suite. Some tests don't say if they have passed or
not. Some tests do not even output anything. Some tests never quit!

If you want to run a comprehensive testsuite, run the gnustep testsuite
http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/gnustep/tests/testsuite
(also ftp://ftp.gnustep.org/pub/gnustep/test).
