THIS INFORMATION IS OUT-OF-DATE.

The library requires gcc @value{GCC-VERSION} or higher.  The
library does not work with the NEXTSTEP 3.2 compiler because that
version of NeXT's cc cannot handle nested functions.  Until a later
release from NeXT, NEXTSTEP users will have to install gcc.  See the
@samp{INSTALL} file for more instructions about compiling and installing
the library.

The library has been successfully compiled and tested with the following
configurations:
@smallexample
  mips-sgi-irix5.2
@end smallexample

Some previous snapshots of the library worked with these configurations,
but they haven't been tested recently.  We are looking for a volunteer
to write a test suite using dejagnu.
