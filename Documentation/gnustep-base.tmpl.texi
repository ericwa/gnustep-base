This manual documents some configuration and installation issues
with the GNUstep Base Library and also differences between the Base
Library and libraries that implement the OpenStep Foundation specification
and the MacOS-X Foundation implementation.

@chapter Overview

*The GNUstep Base Library (gstep-base) requires the GNUstep Makefile
Package (gstep-make) to compile. A recent GCC compiler may also be
needed as well as other libraries. You should consult the
@file{GNUstep-HOWTO} document that comes with the GNUstep Core Libraries
package (gstep-core) or information on supported machines on the web
site @url{http://www.gnustep.org/information}.

Documentation for individual classes is included in gsdoc (and html) format
in the gsdoc directory.

@node Configuration, Classes, Overview, Top
@chapter Configuration

Configuration is performed by running the @file{configure} program at a
shell prompt. You may want to use some of the optional arguments to the
@file{configure} program. Type @code{configure --help}
for a list of these. It is not likely that you will need to use the
@code{--prefix} option, since gstep-base will automatically install in
the directory specified by the @code{GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT} environment
variable (specified when you installed gstep-make).

The only feature you may want to use is the
@code{--enable-pass-arguments} or the @code{--enable-fake-main}
option(s). Normally, the configure script will determine if a program
can read process information directly from the system (for use by the
class NSProcessInfo) and enable or disable the fake-main hack
automatically, but if you find that configure is not doing this
correctly, you can force the fake-main hack to be used, which will
always work. Note that if the fake-main hack is enabled, you need to
include the header file GSConfig.h in you main program -- this is done
by default if you include NSObject.h or Foundation.h. If you want to
avoid the whole idea of the fake-main hack, you can use the
pass-arguments option. In this case you will be forced to call the
NSProcessInfo initializeWithArguments method to pass the program
arguments to NSProcessInfo (This would be done automatically if you use
the NSApplicationMain function in a gui application).

Most other important configuration options are already set when you
configure the gstep-make package.

@node Memory Management, Memory Allocation, Implementation, Implementation
@section Memory Management

The OpenStep standard defines an reference-count based memory management scheme which the GNUstep libraries support.  GNUstep also supports garbage collection
using the Boehm conservative garbage collecting library, though this is
currently (October 1999) in a pre-alpha state.

@node Memory Allocation, Reference Counting, Memory Management, Implementation
@section Memory Allocation

Normally, memory is allocated in zones.  Most memory is allocated from a
default area (returned by the NSDefaultMallocZone()) function.  In  some cases
where you want to ensure that a group of objects are all located in roughly the
same area of memory (for performance reasons) you might create a special zone
large enough to accomodate the objects you wish to create, and allocate the
objects from that area.  This will minimise the paging that your application
needs to do in accessing those objects frequently. With the low price of RAM
in modern systems, paging is likely to be much less of a problem nowadays, and
the need for zoning memory is much lower than it used to be.

At a low-level, memory allocation is performed by two functions -
NSAllocateObject() and NSDeallocateObject(), but you need never normally deal
with these functions - they are there for when you need an unusual degree of
control or performance.  These are the functions called by
[NSObject +allocWithZone:] and [NSObject -dealloc].  If you call
NSAllocateObject() directly to create an instance of a class, you may break
some functionality of that class (such as caching of frequently used objects).

Generally, objects are created using the methods +alloc, -copy, -mutableCopy
and are destroyed using -dealloc.  The allocation methods are covers for the
more versatile +allocWithZone:, -copyWithZone: and -mutableCopyWithZone:
methods (which specify the zone from which the memory is to be allocated,
rather than forcing you to use the default zone).
NSObject also provides +new, which is simply a cover for the
combination of a +alloc and a -init.

The -dealloc method returns the memory occupied by the object to the zone from
which it was originally allocated, it can use the -zone method to determine
which zone this is.

Explicit memory allocation and deallocation is efficient - but when you pass
objects around inside a program (and especially from/to libraries etc) it
quickly becomes difficult and/or inefficient to keep track of who owns an
object and should be responsible for calling it's deallocation method.

To take this problem away, some mechanism is needed.  The OpenStep specification
provides a reference counting mechanism along with a set of conventions that
make memory management easy.  In addition to this, the GNU Objective-C compiler
and the GNUstep system provide a memory sweeping garbage collection mechanism
(using the Boehm conservative garbage collection library).

@node Reference Counting, Garbage Collection, Memory Allocation, Implementation
@section Reference Counting

The reference counting scheme for object allocation/deallocation is quite
simple.  Objects are normally created with a reference count of 1.  An objects
reference count may be increased by callsing -retain, and decreased by calling
-release.  If a -release would make the reference count become zero, the
-dealloc method is automatically called to destroy the object - freeing its
memory.

This simple scheme then becomes more complicated with the addition of
the -autorelease method.  When -autorelease is called for an object, the
object is added to the currently active autorelease pool.  When the autorelease
pool is later destroyed, every object in the pool will have a -release message
sent to it for each time it was added to the pool.  Thus, sending an
-autorelease method to an object is equivalent to sending a -release at some
future point.

In general, when a method (other than the alloc..., copy..., mutableCopy...
and new... methods) returns an object, that object will have been autoreleased,
so you don't need to worry about releasing it yourself.  However, if you wish
to store the object for any length of time, you will need to send it a retain
message, and then send it a release when you have finished with it.

@node Garbage Collection, Time Zone, Reference Counting, Implementation
@section Garbage Collection


@node Time Zone,  , Garbage Collection, Implementation
@section Time Zones

If the GNUstep time zone datafiles become too out of date, one can
download an updated database from @url{ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/} and
compile it as specified in the README file in the NSTimeZones
directory.  (In fact, I believe it's about time they're updated.)

@example
    Time zone names in NSDates should be GMT, MET etc. not
    Europe/Berlin, America/Washington etc.
@end example

The problem with this is that various time zones may use the same
abbreviation (e.g. Australia/@{Brisbane,...@} and America/@{New_York,...@}
both use EST), and some time zones may have different rules for
daylight saving time even if the abbreviation and offsets from UTC are
the same.

The problems with depending on the OS for providing time zone info are
that some methods for the NSTimeZone classes might be difficult to
implement, and also that time zone names may vary wildly between OSes
(this could be a big problem when archiving is used between different
systems).
