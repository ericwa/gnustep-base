@chapter Overview

The GNUstep Base Library (gstep-base) requires the GNUstep Makefile
Package (gstep-make) to compile. A recent GCC compiler may also be
needed as well as other libraries. You should consult the
@file{GNUstep-HOWTO} document that comes with the GNUstep Core Libraries
package (gstep-core) or information on supported machines on the web
site @url{http://www.gnustep.org/information}

@node Configuration, Classes, Overview, Top
@chapter Configuration

Configuration is performed by running the @file{configure} program at a
shell prompt. You may want to use some of the optional arguments to the
@file{configure} program. Type @code{configure --help}
for a list of these. It is not likely that you will need to use the
@code{--prefix} option, since gstep-base will automatically install in
the directory specified by the @code{GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT} environment
variable (specified when you installed gstep-make).

The only feature you may want to use is the @code{--enable-fake-main}
option. Normally, the configure script will determine if a program can
read process information directly from the system (for use by the class
NSProcessInfo) and enable or disable the fake-main hack automatically,
but if you find that configure is not doing this correctly, you can
force the fake-main hack to be used, which will always work. Note that
if the fake-main hack is enabled, you need to include the header file
GSConfig.h in you main program -- this is done by default if you include
NSObject.h or Foundation.h.

Most other important configuration options are already set when you
configure the gstep-make package.

@node Memory Management, Time Zones, Implementation, Implementation
@section Memory Management

The OpenStep standard defines an reference-count based memory management scheme which the GNUstep libraries support.  GNUstep also supports garbage collection
using the Boehm conservative garbage collecting library, though this is
currently (October 1999) in a pre-alpha state.

@node Memory Allocation,  , Reference Counting, Memory Management
@section Memory Allocation

Normally, memory is allocated in zones.  Most memory is allocated from a
default area (returned by the NSDefaultMallocZone()) function.  In  some cases
where you want to ensure that a group of objects are all located in roughly the
same area of memory (for performance reasons) you might create a special zone
and allocate the objects fromn that area.

At a low-level, memory allocation is performed by two functions -
NSAllocateObject() and NSDeallocateObject(), but you need never normally deal
with these functions - they are there for when you need an unusual degree of
control or performance.  These are the functions called by
[NSObject +allocWithZone:] and [NSObject -dealloc].  If you call
NSAllocateObject() directly to create an instance of a class, you may break
some functionality of that class (such as caching of frequently used objects).

Generally, objects are created using the methods +alloc, -copy, -mutableCopy
and are destroyed using -dealloc.  The allocation methods are covers for the
more versatile +allocWithZone:, -copyWithZone: and -mutableCopyWithZone:
methods.  NSObject also provides +new, which is simply a cover for the
combination of a +alloc and a -init.

@node Reference Counting, Memory Allocation, Garbage Collection, Memory Management
@section Reference Counting

The reference counting scheme for object allocation/deallocation is quite
simple.  Objects are normally created with a reference count of 1.  An objects
reference count may be increased by callsing -retain, and decreased by calling
-release.  If a -releae would make the reference count become zero, the
-dealloc method is automatically called to destroy the object - freeing its
memory.

This simple scheme then becomes more complicated with the addition of
the -autorelease method.  When -autorelease is called for an object, the
object is added to the currently active autorelease pool.  When the autorelease
pool is later destroyed, every object in the pool will have a -release message
sent to it for each time it was added to the pool.  Thus, sending an
-autorelease method to an object is equivalent to sending a -release at some
future point.

In general, when a method (other than the alloc..., copy..., mutableCopy...
and new... methods) returns an object, that object will have been autoreleased,
so you don't need to worry about releasing it yourself.  However, if you wish
to store the object for any length of time, you will need to send it a retain
message, and then send it a release when you have finished with it.

@node Time Zone,  , Memory Management, Implementation
@section Time Zones

If the GNUstep time zone datafiles become too out of date, one can
download an updated database from <ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/> and
compile it as specified in the README file in the NSTimeZones
directory.  (In fact, I believe it's about time they're updated.)

@example
    Time zone names in NSDates should be GMT, MET etc. not
    Europe/Berlin, America/Washington etc.
@end example

The problem with this is that various time zones may use the same
abbreviation (e.g. Australia/@{Brisbane,...@} and America/@{New_York,...@}
both use EST), and some time zones may have different rules for
daylight saving time even if the abbreviation and offsets from UTC are
the same.

The problems with depending on the OS for providing time zone info are
that some methods for the NSTimeZone classes might be difficult to
implement, and also that time zone names may vary wildly between OSes
(this could be a big problem when archiving is used between different
systems).

@chapter Coding Standards

This chapter explains the official coding standards which developers
for GNUstep base should follow. Note that these standards are in addition
to GNU coding standards, not a replacement of them.

@node Error Handling,  , Coding Standards, Coding Standards
@section Error Handling

Initialization methods (e.g. -init) should, upon failure to
initialize the class, deallocate itself and return nil. This may mean
in certain cases, that it should catch exceptions, since the calling
method will be expecting a nil object rather than an exception on
failure. However, init methods should endeavor to provide some
information, via NSLog, on the failure.

All other methods should cause an exception on failure*, unless
returning nil is a valid response (e.g. [dictionary
objectForKey: nil]) or if documented otherwise.

Failure here is a relative term. I'd interpret failure to occur when
either system resources have been exceeded, an operation was performed
on invalid data, or a required precondition was not met.
On the other hand, passing a nil object as a parameter (as in
[(NSMutableData *)data appendData: nil]), or other "unusual"
requests should succeed in a reasonable manner (or return nil, if
appropriate) and/or reasonable default values could be used.

If an error is recoverable or it does not damage the internal state of
an object, it's ok not to raise an error. At the very least, though, a message
should be printed through NSLog.

Special care should be taken in methods that create resources like
allocate memory or open files or obtain general system resources (locks,
shared memory etc.) from the kernel. If an exception is generated
between the allocation of the resource and its disposal, the resource
will be simply lost without any possibility to release. The code should
check for exceptions and if something bad occurs it should release all
the allocated resources and reraise the exception.

Unfortunately there is no nice way to do this automatically in OpenStep.
Java has the "finally" block which is specifically designed for this task. A
similar mechanism exists in libFoundation with the CLEANUP and FINALLY
blocks.

@node Contributing, Concept Index, Coding Standards, Top
@chapter Contributing

Contributing code is not difficult. Here are
some general guidelines:

@itemize @bullet

@item
FSF must maintain the right to accept or reject potential contributions.
Generally, the only reasons for rejecting contributions are cases where
they duplicate existing or nearly-released code, contain unremovable
specific machine dependencies, or are somehow incompatible with the
rest of the library. 

@item
Acceptance of contributions means that the code is accepted for adaptation
into libgnustep-base.  FSF must reserve the right to make various editorial changes
in code. Very often, this merely entails formatting, maintenance of various
conventions, etc. Contributors are always given authorship credit and shown
the final version for approval.

@item
Contributors must assign their copyright to FSF via a form sent out
upon acceptance. Assigning copyright to FSF ensures that the code
may be freely distributed.

@item
Assistance in providing documentation, test files, and debugging
support is strongly encouraged.

@end itemize

Extensions, comments, and suggested modifications of existing libgnustep-base
features are also very welcome.
