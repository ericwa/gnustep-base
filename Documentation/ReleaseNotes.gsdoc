          predicates. A few minor api changes have occured as well.
	</p>
	  <deflist>
	    <term>Character sets</term>
	    <desc>
	       Character sets were improved with regard to ranges (chinese
               characters, etc).
	    </desc>
	    <term>Keyed Archiving</term>
	    <desc>
               Better compatibility with MacOSX. In particular, some gueses
               are made as to how some objects should be encoded.
	    </desc>
	    <term>GNUstep configuration file</term>
	    <desc>
               Extra keys are allowed in the configuration file with the
               definition of the GNUSTEP_EXTRA key.
	    </desc>
	    <term>URL Loading</term>
	    <desc>
              Headers and a basic framework for Apple's new URL loading scheme
              were added, although this is not fully implemented yet.
	    </desc>
	    <term>Objective-C++</term>
	    <desc>
               Most of the code was updated to compile nicely with the new
               gcc objective-c++ compiler.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSString designated initializer</term>
	    <desc>
               The GNUstep designated initialiser for the NSString class 
               cluster has changed to 
               <code>-initWithBytesNoCopy:length:encoding:freeWhenDone:</code>
               from 
               <code>-initWithCharactersNoCopy:length:freeWhenDone:</code> 
               and older code subclassing NSString will need to be updated.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSBundle bundleWithIndentifier:</term>
	    <desc>
              The NSBundle method <code>+bundleWithIdentifier:</code> was
              added.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSPredicate</term>
	    <desc>
               A basic implementation of the NSPredicate classes (NSPredicate,
               NSComparisonPredicate, NSCompoundPredicate, NSExpression) was
               added.
	    </desc>
	    <term>Stack traces</term>
	    <desc>
              Support for getting stack traces via bfd was added 
              experimentally. You have to define STACKTRACE when compiling
              base to get this.
	    </desc>
	    <term>Languages</term>
	    <desc>
               Added new language files Esperanto, Korean, and Ukrainian.
	    </desc>
	    <term>Run loops</term>
	    <desc>
              Removed the timeout facility for runloop watchers - you should
              use standard timers instead. The watcher interface is deprecated
              anyway.
	    </desc>
	  </deflist>
      </section>
      <section>
	<heading>Version 1.12.0</heading>
	<p> There have been a number of API changes and several
	methods have been depreciated in this release. Although
	current GNUstep programs that use these methods will still
	work in this version, there are enough changes that a new
	library version was considered useful.
	</p>
	  <deflist>
	    <term>NSCoder deprecated methods</term>
	    <desc>
	    Several methods using the old libObjects style scheme 
	    <code>withName:</code> are now deprecated. You can use the new
	    NSKeyedArchiver and NSKeyedUnarchiver functionality to perform
	    the same function in a much more portable way.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSPortCoder, NSPortMessage private methods</term>
	    <desc>
	    The private method <code>_components</code> was removed
            from the public interface.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSString -getCString:maxLength:encoding:</term>
	    <desc>
	    The return type of this function was changed to BOOL.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSBundle deprecated and private methods</term>
	    <desc>
	    Several deprecated and private methods were removed from
	    the public interface including
	    <code>+gnustepBundle</code>, and
	    <code>+pathForGNUstepResource:ofTpye:inDirectory:</code>.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSNotificationCenter deprecated method</term>
	    <desc>
	    The GNUstep method <code>setLockingDisabled:</code> method
	    was deprecated.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSNotificationQueue private functions</term>
	    <desc>
	    Private functions <code>GSNotifyASAP</code>,
	    <code>GSNotifyIdle</code>, and <code>GSNotifyMore</code>
	    were removed from public interface.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSRunLoop watcher API updates and other changes</term>
	    <desc>
	    We are starting to integrate the Cocoa NSStream classes
	    into GNUstep, which allow you to do much the same things
	    as the GNUstep-specific run loop watcher API was
	    intended. At some point the watcher API will be deprecated
	    as it will be redundant with NSStream functionality. Also
	    the deprecated win32 specific methods for NSRunLoop were
	    removed.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSAttribtedString deprecated method</term>
	    <desc>
	    The non-standard
	    <code>attributedSubstringWithRange:</code> method (just a
	    synonym for the real method) was deprecated.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSConnection, NSDistantObject method removal</term>
	    <desc>
	    Several legacy methods from the original GNU Connection
	    class were removed or moved to the additions category of
	    the library.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSAutoreleasePool private methods</term>
	    <desc>
	    The private method <code>_endThread:</code> was removed
	    from the public interface.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSPortNameServer private methods</term>
	    <desc>
	    Several private methods were removed from the public interface.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSStream, NSIndexPath</term>
	    <desc>
	    New classes added to the library.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSUserDefaults improvements</term>
	    <desc>
	    User defaults were restructured to create the defaults
	    lazily and can be set to not write to an external file at
	    all, for developers who wish to use the library as a
	    stand-alone library or in other situations where using
	    external resources is not desired.
	    </desc>
	  </deflist>
      </section>
      <section>
	<heading>Version 1.11.2</heading>
	  <deflist>
	    <term>GNUstep.conf and relocation</term>
	    <desc>
	    Support for GNUstep.conf and relocation of the filesystem is
	    much improved in this release.
	    </desc>
	    <term>Windows platform</term>
	    <desc>
	    The WM_QUIT message is now intercepted to allow an application to
	    terminate cleanly.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSMessagePort - Windows platform</term>
	    <desc>
	    NSMessagePort was implemented on Windows platforms.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSOpenStepRootDirectory</term>
	    <desc>
	    This function has been un-deprecated, and the documentation
	    clarified so it is easier to understand what it does and does 
	    not do.
	    </desc>
	    <term>GNUsteprc</term>
	    <desc>
	    Deprecated support for system-wide GNUsteprc files has
	    been removed.
	    </desc>
	  </deflist>
      </section>
      <section>
	<heading>Version 1.11.1</heading>
	  <deflist>
	    <term>NSSortDescriptor</term>
	    <desc>
	    New class.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSStringFromPoint, NSStringFromRect, NSStringFromSize</term>
	    <desc>
	    Functions now output strings that can be read by old
	    OpenStep implementations (but can also still be read by GNUstep and
            MacOSX).
	    </desc>
	    <term>Debugging support</term>
	    <desc>
	    More support for debugging on mingw, including writing logs to 
	    debugger and event viewer.
	    </desc>
	  </deflist>
      </section>
      <section>
	<heading>Version 1.11.0</heading>
	<p>
	    The interface version of the base library has changed in
	    this release.  Applications, libraries and tools that
	    wish to use this new version must be recompiled
	    (otherwise, they'll use the older version of the library).
	</p>
	  <deflist>
	    <term>Window's changes</term>
	    <desc>
	    A lot of the behavior of path handling in the base
	    library has changed with respect to Window's machines.
	    Windows native paths are used throughout.
	    The fileSystemRepresentation methods now use utf-16
	    as the external c-string representation on windows.
	    The local to openstep and openstep to local methods
	    are now deprecated and do nothing. Other changes to
	    classes and class variables have also occurred (detailed
	    below).
	    </desc>
	    <term>Path/Startup configuration</term>
	    <desc>
	    At the startup of any application or tool, GNUstep used to
	    look at various environment variables in order to find
	    the location of various data directories and other
	    things. GNUstep still does this, but the environment
	    variables are no longer required to find these
	    files. In addition the configuration files used to
	    override certain path behavior has been changed and
	    expanded. See the base library documentation on GNUstep
	    Configuration Files for more information.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSCharacterSets</term>
	    <desc>
	    Character sets are included in the library itself instead
	    of being loaded from a data file. Also, the
	    NSBitmapCharSet API has been removed.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSPathUtilities</term>
	    <desc>
	    Depreciated functions GSSystemRootDirectory and
	    GSStandardPathPrefixes. In addition, beware of using the
	    function NSOpenStepRoot, which may not necessarily return
	    the information you need (see the documentation for this
	    function for more info). Enumeration values for
	    NSSearchPathDirectory have changed.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSRunLoop</term>
	    <desc>
	    NSRunLoop and related classes now use native win32 event
	    handling on Window's machines. See also GSFileHandle,
	    NSSocketPort and NSMessagePort.
	    </desc>
	    <term>GSFileHandle</term>
	    <desc>
	    This GNUstep specific class has a new ivar on Windows.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSSocketPort, NSMessagePort</term>
	    <desc>
	    This class has a new ivar on Windows.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSPortNameServer</term>
	    <desc>
	    A one-time warning is printed concerning a future change in
	    which nsconnections will only work between processes owned
	    by the same account on
	    the same machine, for MacOSX compatibility and
	    security. If inter-host/user communication is desired,
	    the developer will need to set this explicitly.
	    </desc>
	    <term>Keyed Encoding</term>
	    <desc>
	    Work was done in many classes to support keyed
	    encoding. It may not be fully implemented in every class, however.
	    </desc>
	  </deflist>
      </section>
      <section>
	<heading>Version 1.10.3</heading>
	<p>
	This release includes a few minor bug fixes.
	</p>
      </section>
      <section>
	<heading>Version 1.10.2</heading>
	<p>
	This release is most likely the last release in this series,
	aside from possible bug fixes.
	It was was branched from CVS on Feb 22, 2005.
	</p>
	  <deflist>
	    <term>NSContainsRect behavior change</term>
	    <desc>
	      The definition of NSContainsRect has changed to
	      correspond with the current Mac OS X/Cocoa definition. The
	      sides of the bRect can touch aRect.
	    </desc>
	    <term>Unichar file paths</term>
	    <desc>
	      Windows supports unichar file paths, but there isn't
	      really an API for handling this. GNUstep-specific
	      methods for dealing with this have been
	      added, <code>NSFileManager's
	      -localFromOpenStepPath</code> and
	      <code>openStepPathFromLocal</code> and equivalent methods for
	      <code>NSString</code>. In most cases the Base library should
	      handle this problem internally, but it's possible that there
	      are cases where the developer wants to handle the file name
	      explicitly with system-specific functions.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSDictionaryErnumerator</term>
	    <desc>
	      Some ivars in NSDictionaryEnumerator have changed types,
	      but the total storage space has not changed. This may
	      cause problems if you access ivars directly, perhaps
	      through a subclass.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSNotification -setImmutablePost</term>
	    <desc>
	      This GNUstep extension method was removed.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSPort extension methods</term>
	    <desc>
	      Unimplemented GNUstep extension methods <code>-close</code>,
	      <code>-outPackedClass</code>,
	      and <code>+outPackedClass</code> were removed.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSTimeZone -abbreviationDictionary</term>
	    <desc>
	      <code>NSTimeZone</code>'s abbreviation dictionary is now
	      a proper one-to-one dictionary.
	    </desc>

	    <term>Runtime version discovery of library</term>
	    <desc>
	    A developer can discover the version of the base library that 
	    is loaded using the NSBundle methods
	    <code>[[NSBundle bundleForLibrary: @"gnustep-base"] infoDictionary]</code>
	    and retrieving the <var>GSBundleVersion</var> key.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSXMLParser class added</term>
	    <desc>
	      This is a Cocoa class that has been added for
	      compatibility. The class is still alpha state.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSArray makeObjectsPerformSelector:</term>
	    <desc>
	      The order of iteration through objects was changed to
	      match Cocoa.
	    </desc>
	    <term>Designated initializer changes</term>
	    <desc>
	      The designated initializer for  NSArray, NSDictionary,
	      NSSet, and NSString for MacOS X compatibility. Like
	      MacOS X, you can call <code>[super init]</code> to initialize
	      the class from a subclass, although it is prefered that you use
	      the <em>designated initializer</em>, with it's richer
	      set of initializers.

	    <term>Interface version change</term>
	    <desc>
	    The interface version of the base library has changed in
	    this release, as it will in all future releases with a
	    new minor number (that's the second number in the
	    release number). Applications, libraries and tools that
	    wish to use this new version must be recompiled
	    (otherwise, they'll use the older version of the library).
	    There is no single reason for this change. Arguably, it
	    should have been done long ago.

	    <term>NSString clarification</term>
	    <desc>
	      The NSString documentation contains some clarification
	      on the lifetime of returned NSString objects.
	    </desc>
	    <term>URL classes support persistant connections</term>
	    <desc>
	      The NSURLHandle and other classes have support for
	      persistant connections.
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSMethodSignature clarification</term>
	    <desc>
	      Recent compiler releases have exposed a flaw in the way
	      GNUstep gathers signature information. The
	      documentation explains how the information for offset
	      and registers may not be reliable.
	    </desc>
	    <term>Mac OS X compatibility</term>
	    <desc>
	      There have been many fixes in various classes for Mac
	      OS X compatibility, particularly relating to XML encoding.

	    <term>GSMime parsing ignores extraneous data</term>
	    <desc>
	    When extraneous data is encountered in the input, it is ignored
	    (and a warning logged) rather than adding it to the
	    message body.  Not sure this is right though, perhaps we should
	    raise an exception or extend the api to return the extra
	    data.  Anyway, it's better than the previous behavior of
	    adding the bad data to the parsed body.
	    </desc>
	    <term>New log functions GSOnceFlag and GSOnceMLog</term>
	    <desc>
	    Log messages the first time the code is executed. Typical
	    usage is to log warnings about deprecated features.

	      New MacOSX compatibility class
	    </desc>
	    <term>GSObjCRuntime</term>
	    <desc>
	      Multiple new runtime functions that work with both GNU
	      and Apple runtimes. These functions allow you to look
	      at method lists, add and remove methods (for instance,
	      if you want to make sure your method in a category 
	      overrides another method in a category).
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSProtocolChecker rewritten</term>
	    <desc>
	      Was previously almost non-functional.
	    </desc>
	    <term>autogsdoc</term>
	    <desc>
	      Support added for building frames structured documentation.
	      Add the flag <code>-MakeFrames YES</code> to the autogsdoc
	      command line.
	    </desc>
	    <term>Binary incompatibilities</term>
	    <desc>
	      NSUnarchiver, GSIMapTable have new ivars added to
	      them. Tools and applications that use these classes may
	      need to be recompiled after the new library is installed.
