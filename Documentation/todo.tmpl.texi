@item NSZone memory allocation may not work correctly. If you
encounter a problem with NSZones, switch to using the
default zone instead of creating one. 

@item Invocations (and by extension, Distributed Objects) work well only
on ix86 platforms. In particular, they don't work well on PPC and Sparc
platforms.  

@item Distributed Objects aren't thread safe. Don't use DO
between threads in a multi-theaded app.
