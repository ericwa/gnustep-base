@item Some people have reported NSZone memory allocation problems.
If you encounter a problem with NSZones, switch to using the
default zone instead of creating one. Or better yet, fix the problem and
submit a patch.

@item Invocations (and by extension, Distributed Objects) have been well tested only
on ix86 platforms. In particular, there are still minor problems on PPC and Sparc
platforms.  

@item Distributed Objects is now thread safe, but it hasn't been well
tested.
