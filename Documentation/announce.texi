at @samp{http://www.gnustep.org}.

So that developers of non-free, commercial programs can use the library,
the library is released under the GNU Library GPL.

So that it can easily be included in non-free, comercial software, the
library is released under the GNU Library GPL.

@section Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?

@ifset GNUSTEP-BASE-FTP-MACHINE
The gstepbase-@value{GNUSTEP-BASE-VERSION}.tar.gz distribution file has 
been placed on @samp{@value{GNUSTEP-BASE-FTP-MACHINE}} in
@samp{@value{GNUSTEP-BASE-FTP-DIRECTORY}}.
@end ifset
@ifclear GNUSTEP-BASE-FTP-MACHINE
The libgnustep-base-@value{GNUSTEP-BASE-VERSION}.tar.gz distribution file has
been placed on @samp{@value{GNUSTEP-BASE-SNAP-FTP-MACHINE}} in
@samp{@value{GNUSTEP-BASE-SNAP-FTP-DIRECTORY}}.
@end ifclear

The library requires gcc @value{GCC-VERSION} or higher.
Significant sections of the library do not work with the NeXT runtime,
so we recommend using gcc instead of NeXT's cc.  See the @samp{GNUstep-HOWTO}
file for more instructions about compiling and installing the library.

The @samp{.tar} file is compressed with GNU gzip.  Gzip can be obtained by
anonymous ftp at any of the GNU archive sites.

For info about FTP via email, send email to
@samp{ftpmail@@decwrl.dec.com} with no subject line, and two-line body
with line one @samp{help} and line two @samp{quit}.

The most recent (not necessarily tested) snapshots of the library will
be placed on @samp{@value{GNUSTEP-BASE-SNAP-FTP-MACHINE}}.
