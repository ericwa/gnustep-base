           <p>

             <code>NSObject</code> is the root class (a root class is
             a class with no superclass) of the gnustep base library
             class hierarchy, so all classes normally inherit from
             <code>NSObject</code>.  There is an exception though:
             <code>NSProxy</code> (which is used for remote messaging)
             does not inherit from <code>NSObject</code>.
           </p>

           <p>

             Unless you are really sure of what you are doing, all
             your own classes should inherit (directly or indirectly)
             from <code>NSObject</code> (or in special cases from
             <code>NSProxy</code>).  <code>NSObject</code> provides
             the basic common functionality shared by all gnustep
             classes and objects.
           </p>

           <p>

             The essential methods which must be implemented by all
             classes for their instances to be usable within gnustep
             are declared in a separate protocol, which is the
             <code>NSObject</code> protocol.  Both
             <code>NSObject</code> and <code>NSProxy</code> conform to
             this protocol, which means all objects in a gnustep
             application will conform to this protocol (btw, if you
             don't find a method of <code>NSObject</code> you are
             looking for in this documentation, make sure you also
             look into the documentation for the <code>NSObject</code>
             protocol).
           </p>

           <p>

             Theoretically, in special cases you might need to
             implement a new root class.  If you do, you need to make
             sure that your root class conforms (at least) to the
             <code>NSObject</code> protocol, otherwise it will not
             interact correctly with the gnustep framework.  Said
             that, I must note that I have never seen a case in which
             a new root class is needed.
           </p>

           <p>

             <code>NSObject</code> is a root class, which implies that
             instance methods of <code>NSObject</code> are treated in
             a special way by the Objective-C runtime.  This is an
             exception to the normal way messaging works with class
             and instance methods: if the Objective-C runtime can't
             find a class method for a class object, as a last resort
             it looks for an instance method of the root class with
             the same name, and executes it if it finds it.  This
             means that instance methods of the root class (such as
             <code>NSObject</code>) can be performed by class objects
             which inherit from that root class !  This can only
             happen if the class doesn't have a class method with the
             same name, otherwise that method - of course - takes the
             precedence.  Because of this exception,
             <code>NSObject</code>'s instance methods are written in
             such a way that they work both on <code>NSObject</code>'s
             instances and on class objects.

<hr><h2>Class Methods </h2>
<h3><a name ="method-0">alloc</a></h3>
+ (id) <b>alloc</b>;<br>

	  Allocates a new instance of the receiver from the default
	  zone, by invoking <code>allocWithZone:</code> with
	  <code>NSDefaultMallocZone()</code> as the zone argument.
	  Returns the created instance.
          
 <hr>
<h3><a name ="method-1">allocWithZone:</a></h3>
+ (id) <b>allocWithZone:</b> (NSZone*)zone;<br>

          This is the basic method to create a new instance.  It
          allocates a new instance of the receiver from the specified
          memory zone.  
          <p>

            Memory for an instance of the receiver is allocated; a
            pointer to this newly created instance is returned.  All
            instance variables are set to 0 except the
            <code>isa</code> pointer which is set to point to the
            object class.  No initialization of the instance is
            performed: it is your responsibility to initialize the
            instance by calling an appropriate <code>init</code>
            method.  If you are not using the garbage collector, it is
            also your responsibility to make sure the returned
            instance is destroyed when you finish using it, by calling
            the <code>release</code> method to destroy the instance
            directly, or by using <code>autorelease</code> and
            autorelease pools.
          </p>

          <p>

           You do not normally need to override this method in
           subclasses, unless you are implementing a class which for
           some reasons silently allocates instances of another class
           (this is typically needed to implement class clusters and
           similar design schemes).
          </p>

          <p>

            If you have turned on debugging of object allocation (by
            calling the <code>GSDebugAllocationActive</code>
            function), this method will also update the various
            debugging counts and monitors of allocated objects, which
            you can access using the <code>GSDebugAllocation...</code>
            functions.

<h3><a name ="method-6">description</a></h3>

	    The <code>description</code> factory method describes the class

<h3><a name ="method-7">descriptionWithLocale:</a></h3>

<h3><a name ="method-8">descriptionWithLocale:indent:</a></h3>

	    the <code>descriptionWithLocale:indent:</code> method and appends
            the value returned by that method to the output object.

<h3><a name ="method-16">new</a></h3>
+ (id) <b>new</b>;<br>

          This method is a short-hand for alloc followed by init, that is,
           <p>
<code>
             NSObject *object = [NSObject new];
           </code></p>

          is exactly the same as 
           <p>
<code>
             NSObject *object = [[NSObject alloc] init];
           </code></p>

          <p>

            This is a general convention: all <code>new...</code>
            methods are supposed to return a newly allocated and
            initialized instance, as would be generated by an
            <code>alloc</code> method followed by a corresponding
            <code>init...</code> method.  Please note that if you are 
            not using a garbage collector, this means that instances 
            generated by the <code>new...</code> methods are not 
            autoreleased, that is, you are responsible for releasing 
            (autoreleasing) the instances yourself.  So when you use 
            <code>new</code> you typically do something like:
          </p>

          <p>

            <code>
               NSMutableArray *array = AUTORELEASE ([NSMutableArray new]);
            </code>
         </p>

          <p>

            You do no normally need to override <code>new</code> in
            subclasses, because if you override <code>init</code> (and
            optionally <code>allocWithZone:</code> if you really
            need), <code>new</code> will automatically use your
            subclass methods.
          </p>

          <p>

            You might need instead to define new <code>new...</code>
            methods specific to your subclass to match any
            <code>init...</code> specific to your subclass.  For
            example, if your subclass defines
          </p>

          <p>

            <code>-initWithName:</code>
          </p>
 
          <p>

            it might be handy for you to have a 
          </p>

          <p>

             <code>+newWithName:</code>
          </p>
 
          <p>

            which combines <code>alloc</code> and
            <code>initWithName:</code>.  You would implement it as follows:
          </p>

          <p>

            <code> 
              + (id) newWithName: (NSString *)aName 
                { 
                   return [[self alloc] initWithName: aName]; 
                } 
            </code>

          <p>

            <code>NSObject</code>'s implementation of this method
            destroys the receiver, by returning the memory allocated
            to the receiver to the system.  After this method has been
            called on an instance, you must not refer the instance in
            any way, because it does not exist any longer.  If you do,
            it is a bug and your program might even crash with a
            segmentation fault.
          </p>

          <p>

            If you have turned on the debugging facilities for
            instance allocation, <code>NSObject</code>'s
            implementation of this method will also update the various
            counts and monitors of allocated instances (see the
            <code>GSDebugAllocation...</code> functions for more
            info).
          </p>

          <p>

            Normally you are supposed to manage the memory taken by
            objects by using the high level interface provided by the
            <code>retain</code>, <code>release</code> and
            <code>autorelease</code> methods (or better by the
            corresponding macros <code>RETAIN</code>,
            <code>RELEASE</code> and <code>AUTORELEASE</code>), and by
            autorelease pools and such; whenever the
            release/autorelease mechanism determines that an object is
            no longer needed (which happens when its retain count
            reaches 0), it will call the <code>dealloc</code> method
            to actually deallocate the object.  This means that normally, 
            you should not need to call <code>dealloc</code> directly as 
            the gnustep base library automatically calls it for you when 
            the retain count of an object reaches 0.
          </p>

          <p>

            Because the <code>dealloc</code> method will be called
            when an instance is being destroyed, if instances of your
            subclass use objects or resources (as it happens for most
            useful classes), you must override <code>dealloc</code> in
            subclasses to release all objects and resources which are
            used by the instance, otherwise these objects and
            resources would be leaked.  In the subclass
            implementation, you should first release all your subclass
            specific objects and resources, and then invoke super's
            implementation (which will do the same, and so on up in
            the class hierarchy to <code>NSObject</code>'s
            implementation, which finally destroys the object).  Here
            is an example of the implementation of
            <code>dealloc</code> for a subclass whose instances have a
            single instance variable <code>name</code> which needs to
            be released when an instance is deallocated:
          </p>

          <p>

            <code>
            - (void) dealloc
              {
                RELEASE (name);
                [super dealloc];
              }
            </code>
           </p>

           <p>

             <code>dealloc</code> might contain code to release not
             only objects, but also other resources, such as open
             files, network connections, raw memory allocated in other
             ways, etc.
           </p>

          
 <hr>
<h3><a name ="method-28">description</a></h3>
- (NSString*) <b>description</b>;<br>

	    <p>

	      The <code>description</code> method describes the reciever.
	      In the default GNUstep implementation, this returns an NSString
	      object giving the name of the class of the receiver and the
	      hexadecimal representation of the recievers address enclosed
	      in angle brackets.
	    </p>

	    <p>

	      Generally, classes other than NSObject will override this method
	      to provide a more informative description of their instances.
	    </p>

          
 <hr>
<h3><a name ="method-29">descriptionWithLocale:</a></h3>
- (NSString*) <b>descriptionWithLocale:</b> (NSDictionary*)aLocale;<br>
Standards:  GNUstep<br>

	    The default (NSOBject) implementation of this method simply calls
	    the <code>description</code> method and discards the locale
	    information.

<h3><a name ="method-30">descriptionWithLocale:indent:</a></h3>
- (NSString*) <b>descriptionWithLocale:</b> (NSDictionary*)aLocale <b>indent:</b> (unsigned int)level;<br>
Standards:  GNUstep<br>

	    The default (NSObject) implementation of this method simply calls
	    the <code>descriptionWithLocale:</code> method and discards the
	    level information.
          
 <hr>
<h3><a name ="method-31">descriptionWithLocale:indent:to:</a></h3>
- (NSString*) <b>descriptionWithLocale:</b> (NSDictionary*)aLocale <b>indent:</b> (unsigned int)level <b>to:</b> (id&#60;GNUDescriptionDestination>)output;<br>
Standards:  GNUstep<br>

	    The default (NSObject) implementation of this method simply calls
	    the <code>descriptionWithLocale:indent:</code> method and appends
            the value returned by that method to the output object.
	    <p>

	      Property-list classes (NSString, NSArray, NSDictionary and
	      NSData) will override this method in order to efficiently
	      write descriptions of themselves into property lists.

	    <p>

	      If deallocation notification is turned on, whenever an objects

<h3><a name ="method-47">_dealloc</a></h3>
- (BOOL) <b>_dealloc</b>;<br>

	    <p>

	      Returns a boolean indicating whether the receiver should be
	      deallocated or not.  The default implementation returns YES.
	    </p>

	    <p>

	      This method is called when an objects retain count reaches
	      zero (if deallocation notifications are active).
	    </p>

	    <p>

	      This method is provided so that you can take some sort of
	      action when objects are deallocated ... normally you would
	      override this method in your classes, but you could also
	      override it in a category of NSObject - and perform some
	      action whenever <em>any</em> object is deallocated.
