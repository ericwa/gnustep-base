	  An NSLock is used in multi-threaded applications to protect critical
	  pieces of code. While one thread holds a lock within a piece of code,
	  another thread cannot execute that code until the first thread has
	  given up it's hold on the lock. The limitation of NSLock is that 
	  you can only lock an
	  NSLock once and it must be unlocked before it can be aquired again. 
	  Other lock classes, notably NSRecursiveLock, have 
	  different restrictions.

<h3><a name ="method-0">lockBeforeDate:</a></h3>
- (BOOL) <b>lockBeforeDate:</b> (NSDate*)limit;<br>

	  Attempts to aquire a lock before the date limit passes. It returns YES
	  if it can. It returns NO if it cannot, or if the current thread already
	  has the lock (but it waits until the time limit is up before returning
	  NO).

<h3><a name ="method-1">tryLock</a></h3>
- (BOOL) <b>tryLock</b>;<br>

	  Attempts to aquire a lock, but returns immediately if the lock
	  cannot be aquired. It returns YES if the lock is aquired. It returns
	  NO if the lock cannot be aquired or if the current thread already has
	  the lock.
