	  <p>

	    The NSRange type is used to specify ranges of locations,
	    typically items in an array, characters in a string, and bytes
	    in a data object.
	  </p>

	  <p>

	    As 'boundary' or 'fencepost' errors are a particularly common
	    problem in programming, it is important that you understand
	    how an NSRange works.
	  </p>

	  <p>

	    An NSRange consists of a location and a length.  The points
	    that are considered to lie in a range are the integers from
	    the location to the location plus the length, so the number
	    of points in a range is the length of the range plus one.<br>
	    However, if you consider these points like the marks on a
	    ruler, you can only store information <strong>between</strong>
	    points.  So the number of items that can be stored in a range
	    is the length of the range.
