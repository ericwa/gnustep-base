Here is some introductory info to get you started:

@section Initial reading

The file @samp{NEWS} has the library's feature history.

The file @samp{GNUstep-HOWTO} 
give instructions for installing the library.

@section Preparing to write code

The documentation isn't much to speak of so far.  Better documentation
will be forthcoming, but the library needs to settle first.  For now I
recommend reading the header files.  
The headers for the classes are in @file{./src/include}.

@section How can you help?

@itemize @bullet

@item
Give us feedback!  Tell us what you like; tell us what you think
could be better.  Send bug reports to @email{bug-gnustep@@gnu.org}.

@item
Donate classes.  If you write classes that fit in the libgnustep-base
framework, I'd be happy to include them.

@example
Happy hacking!
