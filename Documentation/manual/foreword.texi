@c Foreword
@unnumbered Foreword

The aim of this document is to provide a GNUstep/Objective-C programming
manual (primarily tutorial in style) for the language, the GNUstep
base library, and the GNUstep makefiles package.

The manual does not cover installation instructions as these vary from
system to system, and are documented fairly well in the GNUstep HOWTO (http://www.gnustep.org).

What we want is a manual to tell programmers how to use the system,
particularly how to program with the base library in Objective-C,
but also to some extent from Java and Guile.

The target audience for this manual is the C, C++, or Java programmer
that wishes to learn to use Objective-C effectively.  We assume that,
while the reader is able to understand English, it is quite possibly
not their native language.

For detailed class reference documentation the reader is directed to the GNUstep Base Library documentation (http://www.gnustep.org), and to the Apple Cocoa Objective-C Foundation documentation (http://www.apple.com).

Other reference documentation is -
@itemize @bullet
@item GNUstep-Java interface (documented as part of JIGS)
@item GNUstep-Guile interface (documented as part of gstep-guile)
@item Installation/configuration (documented in GNUstep HOWTO)
