The files here get installed into
'$GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT/Library/Documentation'.  They provide a simple means for
the user to navigate through the various GNUstep documentation that gets
installed there.  It includes links for the GUI documentation, which may not
necessarily be installed, but it points out that the links might not work.
This approach seemed better than maintaining two separate index files for GUI
and Base.

If you add documentation, you should also add links to it to these HTML files.
