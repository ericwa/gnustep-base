	The GNUstep Base library is a free software package implementing
        the API of the OpenStep Foundation Kit (tm), including later
	additions.  This documentation package describes the core of the
	Base library, for documentation on additional classes, see the
	BaseAdditions documentation package.

	<heading>Compatibility</heading>
	<p>
	  GNUstep is generally compatible with the OpenStep specification and
	  with recent developments of the MacOS (cocoa) API.  Where MacOS
	  deviates from the OpenStep API, GNUstep generally attempts to
	  support both versions.  In some cases the newer MacOS APIs are
	  incompatible with OpenStep, and GNUstep usually supports the richer
	  version. See the
	  <uref url="../General/OpenStepCompliance.html">OpenStep Compliance</uref> section
	  for more information on OpenStep Compliance.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In order to deal with compatiblity issues, GNUstep uses two
	  mechanisms - it provides conditionally compiled sections of
	  the library header files, so that software can be built that
	  will conform strictly to a particular API, and it provides
	  user default settings to control the behavior of the library
	  at runtime.
	</p>
	<subsect>
	  <heading>Conditional compilation</heading>
	  <p>
	    Adding an option to a makefile to define one of the following
	    preprocessor constants will modify the API visible to software
	    being compiled -
	  </p>
	  <deflist>
	    <term>GS_GNUSTEP_V</term>
	    <desc>
	      Specifies the software version of the header being included.<br />
	      Features in that header which are declared as having been
	      introduced at or before the specified version, and not being
	      removed until or after the specified version are available.<br />
	      The version consists of five or six digits ...
	      a major number (0-99) followed by a minor number (00-99) and
	      a subminor number (00-99).<br />
	      Features in the header file are marked as belonging to different
	      version ranges using the
	      <ref type="macro" id="GS_API_VERSION">GS_API_VERSION</ref>
	      macro.<br />
	      NB. This is the <em>native</em> versioning of the library being
	      used via the header file.  You can use this mechanism in your
	      own libraries and frameworks.
	    </desc>
	    <term>GS_OPENSTEP_V</term>
	    <desc>
	      Used only for the software version in sequence of OpenStep
	      specification and the NeXT/Apple implementation of that
	      specification and its extensions.<br />
	      Features in the header being included which are declared
	      as having been introduced at or before the specified version,
	      and not being removed until or after the specified version
	      are available.<br />
	      The version consists of five or six digits ...
	      a major number (1-99) followed by a minor number (00-99) and
	      a subminor number (00-99).<br />
	      A major number of 1 indicates the OpenStep specification ...
	      available as the GS_API_OSSPEC preprocessor constant.<br />
	      A major number of 4 indicates the OPENSTEP implementation ...
	      available as the GS_API_OPENSTEP preprocessor constant.<br />
	      A major number of 10 indicates the MacOS-X implementation ...
	      available as the GS_API_MACOSX preprocessor constant.<br />
	      Features in the header file are marked as belonging to different
	      version ranges using the
	      <ref type="macro" id="GS_API_VERSION">GS_API_VERSION</ref>
	      macro.<br />
	      For MacOS-X compatibility, if this constant is not defined
	      and MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED <em>is</em> defined, then
	      GS_OPENSTEP_V is defined to be MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED.<br />
	      Similarly, for MacOS-X we define MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_2,
	      MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_3 etc as the appropriate numeric version
	      numbers.
	    </desc>
	  </deflist>
	  <p>
	    <em>NB</em> These preprocessor constants are used in
	    <em>developer code</em> (ie the code that users of GNUstep write)
	    rather than by the GNUstep software itself.  They permit a
	    developer to ensure that he/she does not write code which depends
	    upon API not present on other implementations (in practice,
	    MacOS-X or some old OPENSTEP systems).<br />
	    The actual GNUstep libraries are always built with the full
	    GNUstep API in place, so that the feature set is as consistent
	    as possible.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The presence of these macros is also used by autogsdoc to generate
	    information about which version of the API a particular feature
	    belongs to.

	  <deflist>
	    <term>GNU-Debug</term>
	    <desc>
              <p>
              An array of strings that lists debug levels to be used
	      within the program.  These debug levels are merged with
	      any which were set on the command line or added programmatically
	      to the set given by the [NSProcessInfo-debugSet] method.
              </p>
	    </desc>
	    <term>GSLogSyslog</term>
	    <desc>
	      <p>
		Setting the user default <code>GSLogSyslog</code> to
		<code>YES</code> will cause log/debug output to be sent to
		the syslog facility (on systems which support it), rather
		than to the standard error stream.  This is useful in
		environments where stderr has been re-used strangely for
		some reason.<br />
		On mswindows, where syslog does not exist, this flag instead
		controls whether log/debug output is sent to the windows
		event log.
	      </p>
	    </desc>
	    <term>GSLogThread</term>
	    <desc>
	      <p>
		Setting the user default <code>GSLogThread</code> to
		<code>YES</code> will cause NSLog and debug output to
		include the current thread in the logged message.<br />
		This is useful for debugging multi-threaded applications.
	      </p>
	    </desc>
	    <term>GSMacOSXCompatible</term>
	    <desc>
	      <p>
		Setting the user default <code>GSMacOSXCompatible</code> to
		<code>YES</code> will cause MacOS compatible behavior to be
		the default at runtime.  This default may however be overridden
		to provide more fine grained control of system behavior.
	      </p>
	    </desc>
	    <term>GSOldStyleGeometry</term>
	    <desc>
	      <p>
		Specifies whether the functions for producing strings
		describing geometric structures (NSStringFromPoint(),
		NSStringFromSize(), and NSStringFromRect()) should produce
		strings conforming to the OpenStep specification or to
		MacOS-X behavior.  The functions for parsing those strings
		should cope with both cases anyway.
	      </p>
	    </desc>
	    <term>GSSOCKS</term>
	    <desc>
	      <p>
		May be used to specify a default SOCKS5 server (and optionally
		a port separated from the server by a colon) to which tcp/ip
	        connections made using the NSFileHandle extension methods
		should be directed.<br />
		This default overrides the SOCKS5_SERVER and SOCKS_SERVER
		environment variables.
	      </p>
	    </desc>
	    <term>Local Time Zone</term>
	    <desc>
	      <p>
		Used to specify the name of the timezone to be used by the
		<ref type="class" id="NSTimeZone">NSTimeZone</ref> class.
	      </p>
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSWriteOldStylePropertyLists</term>
	    <desc>
	      <p>
		Specifies whether text property-list output should be in
		the default MacOS-X format (XML), or in the more human
		readable (but less powerful) original OpenStep format.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		Reading of property lists is supported in either format,
		but <em>only</em> if GNUstep is built with the libxml
		library (which is needed to handle XML parsing).
	      </p>
	      <p>
		NB. MacOS-X generates illegal XML for some strings - those
		which contain characters not legal in XML.  GNUstep always
		generates legal XML, at the cost of a certain degree of
		compatibility.  GNUstep XML property lists use a backslash
		to escape illegal chatracters, and consequently any string
		containing either a backslash or an illegal character will
		be written differently to the same string on MacOS-X.
	      </p>
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSLanguages</term>
	    <desc>
              <p>
              An array of strings that lists the users prefered languages,
              in order or preference. If not found the default is just 
              English.

	  <heading>Environment variables</heading>
	  <p>
	    There are some environment variables used by GNUstep base, where
	    there would be problems obtaining data from the defaults system.
	  </p>
	  <deflist>
	    <term>CRASH_ON_ABORT</term>
	    <desc>
	      <p>
		The default exception handler will either cause the program to
		simply terminate, or to crash - leaving a core dump.  The
		standard behavior is to leave a core dump if the library was
		built for debugging, and to simply exit if it was not.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		The CRASH_ON_ABORT environment variable can be used to
		override this behavior.  If this is defined to <em>NO</em>,
		<em>FALSE</em>, or <em>0</em> then the program will simply
		exit when an exception occurs.  Any other value of the
		variable will cause the program to generate a core dump.
	      </p>
	    </desc>
	    <term>CRASH_ON_ZOMBIE</term>
	    <desc>
	      <p>
		When the a message is sent to a zombie object (see the
		<code>NSZombieEnabled</code> environment variable) the
		base library allows you to specify whether the program
		should continue after logging the message, or have the
		program abort.<br />
		By default, the program will attempt to continue.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		The <code>CRASH_ON_ZOMBIE</code> variable can be used to
		override this behavior.  If this is defined to <em>YES</em>,
		<em>TRUE</em>, or <em>1</em> then the program will log the
		message sent to the zombie and then abort, producing a
		core dump on systems where that is possible.
	      </p>
	    </desc>
	    <term>GNUSTEP_STACK_TRACE</term>
	    <desc>
	      <p>
	        When this is set to <em>YES</em> a stack trace is
                added to the output of the description method of
                a raised exception object.
	      </p>
	    </desc>
	    <term>GNUSTEP_STRING_ENCODING</term>
	    <desc>
	      <p>
		This is used to specify the default encoding for 8-bit
		strings (those used by 'cstring' methods of NSString).<br />
		It may be any of the 8-bit encodings supported
		by your system.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		If this environment variable is not set, GNUstep attempts
		to use the characterset specified by your operating systems,
		locale information (using the standard nl_langinfo function)
		if possible.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		If there is no usable operating system defined characterset,
		GNUstep defaults to NSISOLatin1StringEncoding.
	      </p>
	    </desc>
	    <term>GNUSTEP_HOST_CPU</term>
	    <desc>
	      <p>
		Used in place of GNUSTEP_TARGET_CPU if the other is missing.
	      </p>
	    </desc>
	    <term>GNUSTEP_HOST_DIR</term>
	    <desc>
	      <p>
		Used in place of GNUSTEP_TARGET_DIR if the other is missing.
	      </p>
	    </desc>
	    <term>GNUSTEP_HOST_OS</term>
	    <desc>
	      <p>
		Used in place of GNUSTEP_TARGET_OS if the other is missing.
	      </p>
	    </desc>
	    <term>GNUSTEP_TARGET_CPU</term>
	    <desc>
	      <p>
		Overrides the default value of the machine (hardware)
		name used on this system.
	      </p>
	    </desc>
	    <term>GNUSTEP_TARGET_DIR</term>
	    <desc>
	      <p>
		Overrides the default path used to locate subdirectories
		for GNUstep binaries withing bundles and applications.
		This is normally equivalent to a path made up of the
		GNUSTEP_TARGET_CPU and GNUSTEP_TARGET_OS
	      </p>
	    </desc>
	    <term>GNUSTEP_TARGET_OS</term>
	    <desc>
	      <p>
		Overrides the default value of the operating system
		name used on this system.
	      </p>
	    </desc>
	    <term>GNUSTEP_TZ</term>
	    <desc>
	      <p>
		Used to specify the timezone to be used if there is no
		timezone specified in the user defaults system.
		The preferred
		mechanism is to use the 'Local Time Zone' value from the
		user defaults system.
	      </p>
	    </desc>
	    <term>GNUSTEP_CONFIG_FILE</term>
	    <desc>
	      <p>
		This functionality may have been disabled if the base library
		was configured/built with the
		<code>--disable-environment-config-file</code> option.<br />
		If it is operational, the environment variable overrides the
		normal path to the gnustep config file used to determine the
		locations of paths for the gnustep system (see later).<br />
		This is provided to support the odd situation where you may
		want to simultaneously run applications using different sets
		of resources but linked to a single copy of the base library,
		or you want to use an alternative config file for some reason.
	      </p>
	    </desc>
	    <term>HOMEDRIVE</term>
	    <desc>
	      <p>
		Used on ms-windows to locate the home directory.
	      </p>
	    </desc>
	    <term>HOMEPATH</term>
	    <desc>
	      <p>
		Used on ms-windows to locate the home directory.
	      </p>
	    </desc>
            <term>LANGUAGES</term>
            <desc>
              <p>
                If there is no NSLanguages user default set, and there is
		no language infromation available in the native system locale
		mechanism, then this environment variable is used to provide
		a list of the languages that the user prefers to use.
		languages listed in this variable must be separated by
		semicolons.
              </p>
            </desc>
            <term>LOGNAME</term>
            <desc>
              <p>
                This is used as the default value for the current user
		(as returned by the NSUserName() functions).  If it is not
		specified, or contains an illegal value, other methods are
		used to get the user name.
              </p>
            </desc>
            <term>LIBRARY_COMBO</term>
            <desc>
              <p>
                Used to override the default value of the combination
		of standard libraries used to build binaries.  This
		value locates the final subdirectory used to locate binaries.
              </p>
            </desc>
	    <term>NSDeallocateZombies</term>
	    <desc>
	      <p>
		This may be used in conjunction with NSZombieEnabled to specify
		whether the objects should really be deallocated.  If you set
		this to YES, the zombie logging will only work until the
		deallocated memory is re-used.
	      </p>
	    </desc>
	    <term>NSZombieEnabled</term>
	    <desc>
	      <p>
		If this is set to YES, then deallocation of an object causes
	        the object to be morphed into a Zombie ... a special object
		which will call the GNUstep specific GSLogZombie() function
		to log the method call.<br />
		You can set a breakpoint in this function and examine the
		process memory if you are running under a debugger.<br />
		As this overrides actual object deallocation, all memory
		allocated for objects will be leaked!<br />
		You can use the <code>CRASH_ON_ZOMBIE</code> environment
		variable to force an abort afdter the message is logged.
	      </p>
	    </desc>
	    <term>SOCKS5_SERVER</term>
	    <desc>
	      <p>
		Specifies the default socks server to be used when making
		outgoing tcp/ip connections using NSFileHandle.  This may
		also specify a port after the host name (and spearated
		from it by a colon).<br />
		This environment variable is used only if the GSSOCKS
		user default is not set.
	      </p>
	    </desc>
	    <term>SOCKS_SERVER</term>
	    <desc>
	      <p>
		Equivalent to SOCKS5_SERVER, but used only if that is not
		defined.
	      </p>
	    </desc>

	    <term>TZ</term>
	    <desc>
	      <p>
		Used to specify the timezone to be used if there is no
		timezone specified by any other mechanism.  The preferred
		mechanism is to use the 'Local Time Zone' value from the
		user defaults system.

	  <heading>GNUstep Configuration File</heading>
	  <p>
	    This file is the master configuration file for GNUstep. It
	    can be used to set the base location of all the standard
	    paths that GNUstep programs use or know about. The
	    location of this file depends on how the Base library was
	    configured and/or what operating system it was configured
	    on. On a GNU/Linux system, the default would be
	    /etc/GNUstep/GNUstep.conf for instance, while on mswindows
	    it would be ./GNUstep.conf.<br />
	    The location of this file can be specified when the base library
	    is configured ... using the <code>--with-config-file=</code>
	    option of the <code>configure</code> script.<br />
	    The configuration file is not actually required to exist, and
	    if it does not exist, then default values will be used.
	    for the standard path locations (these default values may
	    be specified using the <code>--with-default-config=</code>
	    option of the <code>configure</code> script.<br />
	    If you want to <em>force</em> the internal defaults to be used,
	    you can use <code>--with-config-file=</code> to specify a path
	    with a trailing '/' (ie with no filename) as the base library
	    will refrain from trying to load configuration from a file
	    of no name.<br />
	    System paths are defined by the following:
	  </p>
	    <deflist>
	      <term>GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT</term>
	      <desc>
		Used to specify the GNUstep system root directory ... all
		system libraries, tools, applications, headers, resources
		in general are located relative to this.
	      </desc>
	      <term>GNUSTEP_NETWORK_ROOT</term>
	      <desc>
		Used to specify the GNUstep root directory for local
		(non-system) resources that are intended to be shared
		across a local network.  Typically this is an NFS exported
		directory shared by many machines.  It provides an
		alternative to GNUSTEP_LOCAL_ROOT but is usually defined
		to the same value.
	      </desc>
	      <term>GNUSTEP_LOCAL_ROOT</term>
	      <desc>
		Used to specify the GNUstep root directory for local
		(non-system) resources.  Typically all locally produced
		or contributed software is installed relative to this.
	      </desc>
	    </deflist>
	  <p>
	    Paths for each user are defined by the following:
	  </p>
	  <deflist>
	    <term>GNUSTEP_USER_DIR</term>
	    <desc>Path for user specific GNUstep resources (eg. 'GNUstep').
	    Relative to the user's home directory.
	    </desc>
	    <term>GNUSTEP_USER_CONFIG_FILE</term>
	    <desc>Name of user configuration file (eg. '.GNUstep.conf')
	    relative to the user's home directory.<br />
	    Can be specified as an empty string to ensure
	    that no user specific config file is loaded.
	    </desc>
	    <term>GNUSTEP_USER_DEFAULTS_DIR</term>
	    <desc>Name of directory for user defaults files.
	    Relative to the user's home directory.<br />
	    On mswindows this may be set to be ':REGISTRY:' to have defaults
	    stored in the windows registry rather than in the standard file
	    format.<br />
	    On any system this may be set to ':INTERNAL:' to use only
	    internal defaults domains (NSArgumentDomain, NSRegistrationDomain,
	    and GSConfigDomain).
	    </desc>
	  </deflist>
	  <p>
	    The user's home directory is taken to be the standard
	    home directory for that user on the system<br />
	    On unix, that is the user's home directory from the password file,
	    while on windows  it's the value given by the
	    HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH environment variables (or the USERPROFILE
	    environment variable if the others can't be used).
	  </p>

	    These add to the path for NSSystemDomainMask, or
	    NSLocalDomainMask as appropriate.

	    All the above values from the configuration file are made
	    available in the NSUserDefaults system at runtime, in the
	    GSConfigDomain (along with any defaults provided in the
            GlobalDefaults.plist file in the same directory as the
            config file).<br />
	    In addition, the configuration file may contain the key
	    <em>GNUSTEP_EXTRA</em> with a value set to be a comma separated
	    list of extra key names which are to be allowed in the config
	    file.  This lets you add more key/value pairs to the config
	    file intended to be seen in the NSUserDefaults system.<br />
	    However, you must take care that any key names you choose
	    do not conflict with variable names used with the GNUstep
	    Makefiles package or your configuration script may cause
	    problems when building software.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The exact format of the configuration file is expected to 
	    be that of a basic unix "conf" style file, with one
	    <em>key = value</em> per line (the format a unix shell
	    can 'source' in order to define shell variables).<br />
	    This configuration file uses the escape sequence and
	    quoting conventions of the standard bourne shell.<br />
	    The only Keys permitted are those listed above (plus any
	    specified in the GNUSTEP_EXTRA list), and all consist of
	    uppercase letters, digits, and underscores, and must
	    not begin with a digit.<br />
	    A value may be any quoted string (or an unquoted string
	    containing no white space).<br />
	    Lines beginning with a hash '#' are deemed comment lines
	    and ignored.<br />
	    The backslash character may be used as an escape character
	    anywhere in the file  except within a singly quoted string
	    (where it is taken literally).<br />
	    A backslash followed immediately by a newline (except in a
	    singly quoted string) is removed completely along with the
	    newline ... it thus serves to join lines so that they are
	    treated as a single line.<br />
	    NB. Since ms-windows uses backslash characters in paths,
	    it is a good idea to specify path values in the config file
	    as singly quoted strings to avoid having to double all
	    occurrences of the backslash.

	  <p>
	    The configuration files system has two features which make
	    it possible to build standalone packages containing the
	    entire GNUstep system in a form which can be moved anywhere
	    and just run.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Firstly, variables in the configuration file which define
	    paths, are expected to by full path specifications, except
	    for the special case in which they begin with dot-slash (./)
            or dot-dot-slash (../).
	    In this case the path from the variable is appended to the
	    path of the directory containing the configuration file
	    (or the path specified to contain the configuration file if no
	    configuration file exists) to form the value used.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Secondly, If the value of the path built in to the base library
	    as the location of the config file (or specified by
	    the GNUSTEP_CONFIG_FILE environment variable unless that option
	    was disabled when the base library was configured)
	    begins with a dot-slash (./) or dot-dot-slash (../) then the path
            used for that file is made relative to the base library.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    So you can bundle the whole lot together in one directory,
	    and configure various relative paths in that directory, then
	    move the directory around wherever you like.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    If you wish to <em>lock down</em> a production system for
	    distribution as a relocatable package, so it can be installed
	    anywhere, but users can't accidentally change the config file
	    and mess up paths, you can specify the config file name as
	    a path with a trailing slash so that the base library will
	    <em>not</em> read it, and will use the builtin default values.<br />
	    To do this, you would configure using the options
	    <code>--with-config-file=not-used/</code> and
	    <code>--with-default-file=myConfig</code> where <em>myConfig</em>
	    is a file containing the paths you want to use relative to the
	    location the base library gets installed in.<br />
	    The paths from that file will be built in to the base library
	    as defaults, and library will use them rather than attempting
	    to read a config file at runtime.

	  <p>
	    The user specific configuration file is read after the system
	    configuration file and may generally override values from the
	    main file.  To prevent the use specific file from being read,
	    the system manager may define GNUSTEP_USER_CONFIG_FILE in the
	    main file to be an empty string.<br />
	    In any case, the user specific file is <em>not</em> read if a
	    program is running setuid.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Unless disabled (as specified above) the presence of a
	    <code>.GNUstep.conf</code> file in a users home
	    directory permits the user to customize file locations using all
	    the same commands as the system directory, though any attempt
	    to redefine GNUSTEP_USER_CONFIG_FILE is of course ignored.<br />
	    Attempts to redefine the users home directory at this level
	    are also ignored.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    User specific files are stored in the locaton given by
	    GNUSTEP_USER_DIR (by default, the
	    <code>GNUstep</code> subdirectory of the users home
	    directory).<br />
	    The defaults database for a user is stored in the
	    subdirectory of the users home directory given by
	    GNUSTEP_USER_DEFAULTS_DIR (by default, the
	    <code>GNUstep/Defaults</code> subdirectory).
	    On mswindows this may be set to be ':REGISTRY:' to have defaults
	    stored in the windows registry rather than in the standard file
	    format.<br />
	    On any system this may be set to ':INTERNAL:' to use only
	    internal defaults domains (NSArgumentDomain, NSRegistrationDomain,
	    and GSConfigDomain).
