************

The GNUstep Base Library, version 1.3.4, is now available.

What is the GNUstep Base Library?
=================================

   The GNUstep Base Library is a library of general-purpose,
non-graphical Objective C objects.  For example, it includes classes
for strings, object collections, byte streams, typed coders,
invocations, notifications, notification dispatchers, moments in time,
network ports, remote object messaging support (distributed objects),
and event loops.

   It provides functionality that aims to implement the non-graphical
portion of the OpenStep standard (the Foundation library).

   There is more information available at the GNUstep homepage at
`http://www.gnustep.org'.

Noteworthy changes in version `1.3.4'
=====================================

   This is a first pre-release version for 1.4.

   This version also fixes a potentially destructive bug in gdomap. All
users are urged to upgrade to this version as soon as possible.

   * gdomap - don't write pidfile until after setuid away from root

   * New combined Unix/Windows version of NSFileHandle

Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?
==============================================

   The gnustep-base-1.3.4.tar.gz distribution file has been placed on
`ftp.gnustep.org' in `pub/gnustep/core'.

   The library requires gcc 2.8.0 or higher.  See the `GNUstep-HOWTO'
file for more instructions about compiling and installing the library.
