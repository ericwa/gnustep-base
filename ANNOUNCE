The GNUstep Base Library, version 1.7.2, is now available.

What is the GNUstep Base Library?
=================================

   The GNUstep Base Library is a library of general-purpose,
non-graphical Objective C objects.  For example, it includes classes
for strings, object collections, byte streams, typed coders,
invocations, notifications, notification dispatchers, moments in time,
network ports, remote object messaging support (distributed objects),
and event loops.

   It provides functionality that aims to implement the non-graphical
portion of the OpenStep standard (the Foundation library).

   There is more information available at the GNUstep homepage at
`http://www.gnustep.org'.

   Note that versions that have a odd minor release number (the second
number, y, in x.y.z) are unstable releases (like 1.5.2), which even
minor release numbers (1.4.1) are stable releases.

Noteworthy changes in version `1.7.2'
=====================================

   * NSUndoManager improvements

   * New NSMessagePort implementation.

   * Private GSTcpPort becomre NSSocketPort.

   * Improvements to handle selectors better over remote connections.

Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?
