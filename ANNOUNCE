************

The GNUstep Base Library, version 1.7.1, is now available.

What is the GNUstep Base Library?
=================================

   The GNUstep Base Library is a library of general-purpose,
non-graphical Objective C objects.  For example, it includes classes
for strings, object collections, byte streams, typed coders,
invocations, notifications, notification dispatchers, moments in time,
network ports, remote object messaging support (distributed objects),
and event loops.

   It provides functionality that aims to implement the non-graphical
portion of the OpenStep standard (the Foundation library).

   There is more information available at the GNUstep homepage at
`http://www.gnustep.org'.

   Note that versions that have a odd minor release number (the second
number, y, in x.y.z) are unstable releases (like 1.5.2), which even
minor release numbers (1.4.1) are stable releases.

Noteworthy changes in version `1.7.1'
=====================================

   Bug fixes.

Noteworthy changes in version `1.7.0'
=====================================

   See gnustep-make for comments on the filesystem change. Some
components of gnustep-base are now stored in different directories and
in some cases you should use different methods to look for them. Use
+pathForLibraryResource:ofType:inDirectory: instead of
+pathForGNUstepResource:. Also try using +bundleForLibrary:.

   gnustep-base is now documentated as OpenStep complient. Other
changes:

   * Add GSApplicationSupportDirectory for
     NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains.

   * Added man page for gdomap

Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?
==============================================

   The gnustep-base-1.7.1.tar.gz distribution file has been placed on
`ftp.gnustep.org' in `pub/gnustep/core'.
