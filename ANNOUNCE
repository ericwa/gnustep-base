************

The GNUstep Base Library, version 1.10.0, is now available.

What is the GNUstep Base Library?
=================================

The GNUstep Base Library is a library of general-purpose, non-graphical
Objective C objects.  For example, it includes classes for strings,
object collections, byte streams, typed coders, invocations,
notifications, notification dispatchers, moments in time, network ports,
remote object messaging support (distributed objects), and event loops.

   It provides functionality that aims to implement the non-graphical
portion of the OpenStep standard (the Foundation library).

   There is more information available at the GNUstep homepage at
`http://www.gnustep.org'.

Noteworthy changes in version `1.10.0'
======================================

Note the interface version of the library has changed so that apps,
tools and libraries the use the base library need to be recompiled to
use it.

   * A large majority of the library classes have been documented
     thanks to the efforts of Andrew Ruder

   * URL classes support persistant connections

   * Mac OSX XML compatibility fixes.

Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?
==============================================

The gnustep-base-1.10.0.tar.gz distribution file has been placed on
`ftp.gnustep.org' in `pub/gnustep/core'.
