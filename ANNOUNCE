************

The GNUstep Base Library, version 1.11.2, is now available.

What is the GNUstep Base Library?
=================================

The GNUstep Base Library is a library of general-purpose, non-graphical
Objective C objects.  For example, it includes classes for strings,
object collections, byte streams, typed coders, invocations,
notifications, notification dispatchers, moments in time, network ports,
remote object messaging support (distributed objects), and event loops.

   It provides functionality that aims to implement the non-graphical
portion of the OpenStep standard (the Foundation library).

   There is more information available at the GNUstep homepage at
`http://www.gnustep.org'.

Noteworthy changes in version `1.11.2'
======================================

   * Support for GNUstep.conf and relocation of the filesystem is much
     improved in this release.

   * The WM_QUIT message is now intercepted to allow an application to
     terminate cleanly.

   * NSMessagePort was implemented on Windows platforms.

   * Deprecated support for system-wide GNUsteprc files has been
     removed.

   * Some support for keeping user defaults in the Windows registry
     implemented.
