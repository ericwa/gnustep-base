Announcement
************

The GNUstep Base Library, version 1.10.2, is now available.

What is the GNUstep Base Library?
=================================

The GNUstep Base Library is a library of general-purpose, non-graphical
Objective C objects.  For example, it includes classes for strings,
object collections, byte streams, typed coders, invocations,
notifications, notification dispatchers, moments in time, network ports,
remote object messaging support (distributed objects), and event loops.

   It provides functionality that aims to implement the non-graphical
portion of the OpenStep standard (the Foundation library).

   There is more information available at the GNUstep homepage at
`http://www.gnustep.org'.

Noteworthy changes in version `1.10.2'
======================================

This version mostly includes minor fixes and updates.

   * The definition of NSContainsRect has changed to correspond with the
     current Mac OS X/Cocoa def - the sides of the bRect can touch
     aRect.

   * Add support for systems that support unichar file paths (e.g.
     Windows).

   * Use a proper one-to-one abbreviation dictionary for NSTimeZone.

Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?
==============================================

The gnustep-base-1.10.2.tar.gz distribution file has been placed on
`ftp.gnustep.org' in `pub/gnustep/core'.
