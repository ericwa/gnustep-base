Announcement
************

The GNUstep Base Library, version 1.9.0, is now available.

What is the GNUstep Base Library?
=================================

   The GNUstep Base Library is a library of general-purpose,
non-graphical Objective C objects.  For example, it includes classes
for strings, object collections, byte streams, typed coders,
invocations, notifications, notification dispatchers, moments in time,
network ports, remote object messaging support (distributed objects),
and event loops.

   It provides functionality that aims to implement the non-graphical
portion of the OpenStep standard (the Foundation library).

   There is more information available at the GNUstep homepage at
`http://www.gnustep.org'.

   Note that versions that have a odd minor release number (the second
number, y, in x.y.z) are unstable releases (like 1.5.2), while even
minor release numbers (1.4.1) are stable releases.

Noteworthy changes in version `1.9.0'
=====================================

   * Lazy locking implemented (see GSLock documentation)

   * MacOSX PB files updated to 10.3

   * DO retain/release implementation simplified and also handles some
     complex DO retain/release problems.

   * GNUSTEP_STRING_ENCODING now supports any valid iconv name.

   * gdomap uid/gid fixes

   * NSString subclass heirarchy reorganized to fix problems with
     copying and ownership of data.

Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?
==============================================

   The gnustep-base-1.9.0.tar.gz distribution file has been placed on
`ftp.gnustep.org' in `pub/gnustep/core'.
