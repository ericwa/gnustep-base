************

The GNUstep Base Library, version 0.9.1, is now available.

What is the GNUstep Base Library?
=================================

   The GNUstep Base Library is a library of general-purpose,
non-graphical Objective C objects.  For example, it includes classes
for strings, object collections, byte streams, typed coders,
invocations, notifications, notification dispatchers, moments in time,
network ports, remote object messaging support (distributed objects),
event loops, and random number generators.

   It provides functionality that aims to implement the non-graphical
portion of the OpenStep standard (the Foundation library).

   There is more information available at the GNUstep homepage at
`http://www.gnustep.org'.

Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?
==============================================

   The gstepbase-0.9.1.tar.gz distribution file has been placed on
`ftp.gnustep.org' in `pub/gnustep/core'.

   The library requires gcc 2.8.0 or higher.  Significant sections of
the library do not work with the NeXT runtime, so we recommend using
gcc instead of NeXT's cc.  See the `GNUstep-HOWTO' file for more
instructions about compiling and installing the library.

   The `.tar' file is compressed with GNU gzip.  Gzip can be obtained by
anonymous ftp at any of the GNU archive sites.

   For info about FTP via email, send email to `ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com'
with no subject line, and two-line body with line one `help' and line
two `quit'.

   The most recent (not necessarily tested) snapshots of the library
will be placed on `alpha.gnu.org'.
