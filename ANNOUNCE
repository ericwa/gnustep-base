Announcement
************

The GNUstep Base Library, version 1.11.0, is now available.

What is the GNUstep Base Library?
=================================

The GNUstep Base Library is a library of general-purpose, non-graphical
Objective C objects.  For example, it includes classes for strings,
object collections, byte streams, typed coders, invocations,
notifications, notification dispatchers, moments in time, network ports,
remote object messaging support (distributed objects), and event loops.

   It provides functionality that aims to implement the non-graphical
portion of the OpenStep standard (the Foundation library).

   There is more information available at the GNUstep homepage at
`http://www.gnustep.org'.

Noteworthy changes in version `1.11.0'
======================================

This release is binary incompatible with previous releases.  The
interface version of the library has changed so that apps, tools and
libraries that use the base library need to be recompiled to use this
new version.

   * Window's path handling has changed to use native paths throughout.

   * Startup/configuration of the libraries no longer requires
     environement variables.

   * Character sets are included in the library rather than being read
     from data files.

   * NSRunLoop and related classes use natvie win32 event handling on
     Windows machines.

Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?
