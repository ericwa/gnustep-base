**************

The GNUstep Base Library, version 1.20.0, is now available.

1.1 What is the GNUstep Base Library?
=====================================

The GNUstep Base Library is a library of general-purpose, non-graphical
Objective C objects.  For example, it includes classes for strings,
object collections, byte streams, typed coders, invocations,
notifications, notification dispatchers, moments in time, network ports,
remote object messaging support (distributed objects), and event loops.

   It provides functionality that aims to implement the non-graphical
portion of the OpenStep standard (the Foundation library).

   There is more information available at the GNUstep homepage at
`http://www.gnustep.org'.

1.2 Noteworthy changes in version `1.20.0'
==========================================

This is a stable release. There have been major changes and
reorganizations to support, among other things, the new non-fragile ABI
from clang. These changes, although they break binary compatibility
with previous releases, should allow all future releases to maintain
compatibility.

1.3 Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?
==================================================

The gnustep-base-1.20.0.tar.gz distribution file has been placed at
`ftp://ftp.gnustep.org/pub/gnustep/core'.

Please log bug reports on the GNUstep project page
