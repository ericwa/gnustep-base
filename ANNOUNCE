Announcement
************

The GNUstep Base Library, version 1.7.3, is now available.

What is the GNUstep Base Library?
=================================

   The GNUstep Base Library is a library of general-purpose,
non-graphical Objective C objects.  For example, it includes classes
for strings, object collections, byte streams, typed coders,
invocations, notifications, notification dispatchers, moments in time,
network ports, remote object messaging support (distributed objects),
and event loops.

   It provides functionality that aims to implement the non-graphical
portion of the OpenStep standard (the Foundation library).

   There is more information available at the GNUstep homepage at
`http://www.gnustep.org'.

   Note that versions that have a odd minor release number (the second
number, y, in x.y.z) are unstable releases (like 1.5.2), while even
minor release numbers (1.4.1) are stable releases.

Noteworthy changes in version `1.7.3'
=====================================

   Note in this version there have been large changes to the location of
header files (both in the package and when installed). It's possible
(though unlikely) that certain applications that rely on GNUstep
specific headers may not compile because of this.

   * A number of Protocol and DO fixes.

   * New TraditionalChinese language.

Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?
==============================================

   The gnustep-base-1.7.3.tar.gz distribution file has been placed on
`ftp.gnustep.org' in `pub/gnustep/core'.
