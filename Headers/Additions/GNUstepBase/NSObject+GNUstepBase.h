  WARNING: The -compare: method for NSObject is deprecated

           Comparision of arbitrary objects is not just meaningless
           but also dangerous as most concrete implementations
           expect comparable objects as arguments often accessing
	   instance variables directly.
	   This method will be removed in a future release.
