Language files which contain non-ascii characters should either be unicode
files or should encode those characters as \u escape sequences so that they
are usable on systems where the default C-String encoding is not the same
as the one on which the language files were created!

Since it is generally not easy to edit unicode directly, or enter the
correct unicode escape sequences, it is recommended that you use the
cvtenc tool to perform conversions of the files before and after editing
in the default encoding used by your system.

For example, to edit the French language file so that it contains an ascii
propertly list with \u escape sequeneces, you wcould do -

cvtenc -EscacpeIn yes French > tmpfile
vi tmpfile
cvtenc -EscapeOut yes tmpfile > French
rm tmpfile
