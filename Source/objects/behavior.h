/* Call this method from CLASS's +initialize method to add a behavior
   to CLASS.  A "behavior" is like a protocol with an implementation.

   This functions adds to CLASS all the instance and factory methods
   of BEHAVIOR as well as the instance and factory methods of
   BEHAVIOR's superclasses (We stop adding super classes as soon as we
   encounter a common ancestor.)  CLASS and BEHAVIOR should share the
   same instance variable layout.

   We do not yet deal with Protocols; perhaps we should. 

   The semantics of this stuff is pretty fragile.  I don't recommend
   that you use it in code you write.  It might go away completely in
   future.
