/* This file defines macros for managing internal (hidden) instance variables
 * of a public class so that users of the public class don't need to recompile
 * their code when the class implementation is changed in new versions of the
 * library.
 *
 * The public class MUST contain an instance variable 'id _internal;' to be
 * used as a pointer to a private class containing the ivars.
 *
 * Before including this file, you must define 'GSInternal' to be the name
 * of your public class with * 'Internal' appended.
 * eg. if your class is called 'MyClass' then use the following define:
 * #define GSInternal MyClassInternal
 *
 * After including this file you can use the GS_BEGIN_INTERNAL() and
 * GS_END_INTERNAL() macros to bracket the declaration of the instance
 * variables.
 *
 * You use GS_CREATE_INTERNAL() in your intialiser to create the object
 * holding the internal instance variables, and GS_DESTROY_INTERNAL() to
 * get rid of that object (only do this if '_internal' is not nil) in
 * your -dealloc method.
 *
 * Instance variables are referenced using the 'internal->ivar' suntax or
 * the GSIV(classname,object,ivar) macro.
 *
 * If built with CLANG (assumed to support non-fragile instance variables)
 * rather than GCC, the compiler/runtime can simply declare instance variables
 * within the implementation file so that they are not part of the public ABI,
 * in which case the macros here mostly reduce to nothing and the generated
 * code can be much more efficient.
