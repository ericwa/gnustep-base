Directions for creating a libobjects patch
---------------------------------------------------------------

0. Have somewhere an old, pristine version of the libobjects
directory.  We'll assume this directory is called "libobjects-old".

1. Have somewhere a new, changed version of the libobjects directory.
We'll assume this directory is called "libobjects", and that it has
the same parent directory as "libobjects-old"

2. cd to the common parent directory of your two libobjects directories.

3. Create the patch with 
	diff -r -c2 libobjects-old libobjects >my.patch"

4. Add a GNU-style ChangeLog entry to the top of the patch.  You can
do this from within emacs using M-x add-change-log-entry.

5. If you want to include a short note of explanation to me
personally, put it at the top, above the ChangeLog entry.

6. Mail the file to mccallum@gnu.ai.mit.edu.

---------------------------------------------------------------

For a beautiful example from Adam Fedor, see the file example.patch.

If you send me multiple patches to the same file between releases of
libobjects, please diff against a version that has your previous patches.

[I just threw these directions together.  If you have constructive
suggestions for improving these directions, please send them to me.
