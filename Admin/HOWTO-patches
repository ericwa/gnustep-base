Directions for creating a GNUstep Base Library patch
---------------------------------------------------------------

0. Have somewhere an old, pristine version of the gstep-base
directory.  We'll assume this directory is called "gstep-base-old".

1. Have somewhere a new, changed version of the gnustep-base directory.
We'll assume this directory is called "gstep-base", and that it has
the same parent directory as "gstep-base-old"

2. cd to the common parent directory of your two gstep-base directories.

3. Create the patch with 
	diff -r -N -u gstep-base-old gstep-base >my.patch"
   The `-u' requests a `unified-diff' style patch.  If your version of
   diff doesn't support this, pass `-c2' instead of `-u'.

4. Add a GNU-style ChangeLog entry to the top of the patch.  You can
   do this from within emacs using M-x add-change-log-entry.

5. If you want to include a short note of explanation to me
personally, put it at the top, above the ChangeLog entry.

6. Mail the file to mccallum@gnu.ai.mit.edu.

For a beautiful example from Adam Fedor, see the file example.patch.

If you send me multiple patches to the same file between releases of
gstep-base, please diff against a version that has your previous patches.

[I just threw these directions together.  If you have constructive
suggestions for improving these directions, please send them to me.
