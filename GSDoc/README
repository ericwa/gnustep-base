GSDoc should probably be part of the 'Tools' directory of gstep-base,
but it depends on a version of the gnome XML parsing library that is
probably not available on most machines.

Before doing anything else - you need to install the Gnome xml parser library!

I build gsdoc using the 2.0.0 release of the parser.

You can find out how to get this from http://www.xmlsoft.org

Once you have installed the xml parser library, you can build gsdoc
and install it.

Run gsdoc giving it the name of a gsdoc file as an argument, and it will
produce an html output file.

This is an alpha release of the software - please send fixes and improvements
to rfm@gnu.org

Volunteers to write gsdoc->info or gsdoc->TeX or any other translators are
very welcome.
