<h2><a name="cont-0">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>

	  The GSDoc markup language is an XML language designed specifically
	  for writing documentation for the
	  <a href="http://www.gnustep.org">GNUstep project</a>.
	  In practice, that means that it is designed for writing about
	  software, and in particular, for writing about Objective-C classes.
	</p>
<p>

	  This is also an example, as well as a test case, of the new
	  GNUstep documentation markup language (GSDoc).
	</p>
<h3><a name="cont-1">Why another documentation language?</a></h3>
<p>

	    There are several reasons for producing the new markup
	    language -
	  </p>
<ul>
<li>
	      There were no existing markup languages that dealt well with
	      documenting software written in the Objective-C language,
	      except the GDML language - which has no easy to use support
	      software.
	    
<li>
	      While the DocBook system works nicely for general software
	      documentation, it requires a relatively large amount of
	      support software and comes with a lot of baggage that's
	      not directly useful for GNUstep.
	    
<li>
	      The GNU info system comes with easy to use, lightweight
	      conversion tools, but is particularly ill suited to
	      Objective-C documentation because the colon character
	      using in Objective-C method names is used in info markup.
	    
<li>
	      LinuxDoc, while bening a nice basic system, seesm to be
	      in the process of being replaced by DocBook.
	    
</ul>
<p>

	    So, with only one markup language available that supported
	    Objective-C, and with XML software becoming available, the
	    decision was to take GDML and update it to be an XML
	    language, in the hope that this would - 
 	  </p>
<ul>
<li>
	      Provide optimal support for GNUstep documentation.
	    
<li>
	      Minimise the amount of work needed for development of
	      software tools.
	    
<li>
	      Provide future-proofing in that documentation written in one
	      XML language should be quite easy to convert to another if
	      necessary.
	    
</ul>
<h2><a name="cont-2">The gsdoc DTD and what it means</a></h2>
<p>

	The GSDoc markup language is defined by an SGML DTD, that specifies
	the tags that may be used in marking up a GSDoc document, and how
	and where those tags may be placed.  Please see the DTD for a
	precise specification.
      </p>
<p>

	The gsdoc DTD defines an XML language - that is, a markup language
	that conforms to a specific subset of SGML features defined as XML.
	The advantage of XML is that it provides most of the useful features
	of SGML while being much more light-weight (easy to use) beacause
	you can forget about the rest of SGML.
	As XML looks set to become increasingly popular, we can hope that
	documentation written with an XML language will be easily imported
	into XML software tools as they become available, so we will not
	(in the GNUstep project) need to devote a lot of time and effort
	to maintaining documentation tools.
      </p>
<h3><a name="cont-3">Overall document structure</a></h3>
<p>

	  A GSDoc document consists of a <a href="#label-head">head</a> and a
	  <a href="#label-body">body</a> wrapped inside the overall document
	  framework that looks like this -
	</p>
<a name="label-0">example</a>
<pre>

&#60;?xml version="1.0"?>
&#60;!DOCTYPE gsdoc PUBLIC "-//GNUstep//DTD gsdoc 0.6.5//EN" "http://www.gnustep.org/gsdoc-0_6_5.xml">
&#60;gsdoc base="MyDoc" prev="First.html" next="Last.html" up="Overview.html">
  &#60;head>
  ... your document head here
  &#60;/head>
  &#60;body>
  ... your document body here
  &#60;/body>
&#60;/gsdoc>
	
</pre>
<p>

	  The above example shows a GSDoc document framework.
	  The first line specifies the XML version that the document
	  conforms to.
	  The second line specifies the version of GSDoc that the
	  document conforms to.
	  The third and final lines frame the main part of the document
	  and supply all the (optional) attributes of the <em>gsdoc</em>
	  element -
 	</p>
<dl>
<dt>base
<dt>
	    This is optional, but recommended - it specifies the base name
	    for the document.  When the document is tranlated to another
	    format, the outut file name should be based on this - eg.
	    if the base name of a document is <em>foo</em> then an html
	    output for this file would be <em>foo.html</em>.
	  
<dt>prev
<dt>
	    This optional attribute may be used as the name of a document
	    that precedes this one in logical reading order.  If the
	    converted output format of the document supports some sort of
	    link between documents, the converter software may insert
	    a link between the two documents.
	  
<dt>next
<dt>
	    This optional attribute may be used as the name of a document
	    that follows this one in logical reading order.  If the
	    converted output format of the document supports some sort of
	    link between documents, the converter software may insert
	    a link between the two documents.
	  
<dt>up
<dt>
	    This optional attribute may be used as the name of a document
	    that is above this document in some sort of hierarchical
	    structure (a contents list perhaps).
	    If the converted output format of the document supports some sort
	    of link between documents, the converter software may insert
	    a link between the two documents.

<h2><a name="cont-4">The gsdoc conversion tool</a></h2>
<p>

	The gsdoc tool is written in Objective-C and uses the GNUstep base
	library and the Gnome XML parser library.
      </p>
<p>

	This tool is intended to convert GSDoc documents to other formats
	though, at present, only HTML output is supported.
      </p>
<p>

	Use of the tool is trivial - just provide it with a list of gsdoc
	file names, and it will produce a load of html output files.
