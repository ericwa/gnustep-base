       ggddoommaapp  The  gdomap  daemon is used by GNUstep programs to
       lookup distributed objects of  processes  running  on  the
       local machine as well as across the network.

       Usually  the  gdomap daemon is started at system boot time
       and binds itself to port 538. See the _G_N_U_s_t_e_p _B_u_i_l_d  _G_u_i_d_e
       for a sample startup script.


       Gdomap  normally probes every machine on the local network
       to see if there is a copy of gdomap running on  it.   This
       is  done  for class-C networks and subnets of class-C net-
       works.  If your host is on a class-B or class-A  net  then
       the  default behaviour is to treat it as a class-C net and
       probe only the hosts that would be expected on  a  class-C
       network of the same number.

       If  you are running on a class-A or class-B network, or if
       your net has a large number of hosts which will  not  have
       gdomap  on  them  - you may want to supply a configuration
       file listing the hosts to  be  probed  explicitly,  rather
       than getting gdomap to probe all hosts on the local net.

       You may also want to supply the _c_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_a_t_i_o_n _f_i_l_e so that
       hosts which are not actually on  your  local  network  can
       still  be  found when your code tries to connect to a host
       using @"*" as the host name.  NB. this functionality  does
       not exist in OpenStep.

       A _c_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_a_t_i_o_n _f_i_l_e consists of a list of IP addresses to
       be probed.  The IP addresses should be in  standard  'dot'
       notation,  one per line.  Empty lines are permitted in the
       configuration file.  Anything on a line after a hash ('#')
       is  ignored.   You  tell gdomap about the config file with
       the '-c' command line option.


       gdomap uses the SIOCGIFCONF ioctl to build a  list  of  IP
       addresses  and netmasks for the network interface cards on
       your machine.  On some operating systems, this facility is
       not  available (or is broken), so you must tell gdomap the
       addresses and masks of the interfaces using the '-a'  com-
       mand line option.  The file named with '-a' should contain
       a series of lines with space separated pairs of  addresses
       and  masks  in 'dot' notation.  You must NOT include loop-
       back interfaces in this list.   If  you  want  to  support
       broadcasting  of  probe  information on a network, you may
       supply the broadcast address as a third item on the  line.
       If  your  operating system has some other method of giving
       you a list of network interfaces and masks, please send me
       example code so that I can implement it in gdomap.
