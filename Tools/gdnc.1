.SH NAME
gdnc \- GNUstep Distributed Notification Center
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gdnc
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
The gdnc daemon is used by GNUstep programs to send notifications and 
messages to one another.
.P
Every user needs to have his own instance of
.B gdnc
running. While
.B gdnc
will be started automatically as soon as it is needed,
it is recommended to start
.B gdnc
in a personal login script like ~/.bashrc or ~/.cshrc.
Alternatively you can launch gpbs when your windowing system or the
window manager is started. For example, on systems with X11 you can launch
.B gdnc
from your .xinitrc script or alternatively
- if you are running Window Maker - put it in Window Maker's autostart script.
See the
.I GNUstep Build Guide
for a sample startup script.
.P
.SH OPTIONS
To attach
.B gdnc
to a remote session use the
.IP "\fB-NXHost \fIhostname" 
argument.
.P
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.B gdomap -L GDNCServer
will lookup instances of gdnc.
.P
Alternatively, 
.B gdomap -N
will list all registered names on the local host.
