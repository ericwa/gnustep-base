       The  gdnc daemon is used by GNUstep programs to send noti-
       fications and messages to one another.

       Every user needs to have his own instance of gdnc running.
       While  gdnc will be started automatically by applications,
       it is recommend to start gdnc in a personal  login  script
       like  .bashrc  or  .cshrc.   This avoids error messages as
       well as additional waiting times on application  launches.
       Alternatively you could launch gdnc when X11 is started or
       - if you are running Window Maker - put it Window  Maker's
       autostart script. See the _G_N_U_s_t_e_p _B_u_i_l_d _G_u_i_d_e for a sample
       startup script.
