The GNUstep Base Library is a library of general-purpose, non-graphical
Objective C objects.  For example, it includes classes for strings,
object collections, byte streams, typed coders, invocations,
notifications, notification dispatchers, moments in time, network ports,
remote object messaging support (distributed objects), event loops, and
random number generators.

   It provides functionality that aims to implement the non-graphical
portion of the OpenStep standard (the Foundation library).

   Here is some introductory info to get you started:

Initial reading
===============

   The file `NEWS' has the library's feature history.

   The file `GNUstep-HOWTO' give instructions for installing the
library.

Preparing to write code
=======================

   The documentation isn't much to speak of so far.  Better
documentation will be forthcoming, but the library needs to settle
first.  For now I recommend reading the header files.  The headers for
the classes are in `./src/include'.

How can you help?
=================

   * Give us feedback!  Tell us what you like; tell us what you think
     could be better.  Send bug reports to <bug-gnustep@gnu.org>.

   * Donate classes.  If you write classes that fit in the
     libgnustep-base framework, I'd be happy to include them.

     Happy hacking!
