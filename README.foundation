The OpenStep docs all have Foundation.  It's a bit cumbersome to switch 
between them, but I assume when NeXT 4.0 comes out, they will have all 
switched to capital "Foundation". I don't really know though.  For now I 
have this in my configure:

AC_CHECK_HEADER(foundation/NSObject.h, found_objects=1 next_foundation=1, 
	found_objects=0 next_foundation=0)
if test $next_foundation = 1; then
    AC_DEFINE(NEXT_FOUNDATION)
    AC_DEFINE(NS_BLOCK_ASSERTIONS)
fi

and in each header file:

#ifdef NEXT_FOUNDATION
#import <foundation/NSObject.h>
#else
#include <Foundation/NSObject.h>
#endif


As I said, cumbersome, but it should work with ANY OpenStep complient 
foundation.


[Alternatively, you could just make a soft link from `foundation' to
`Foundation' -mccallum.]
